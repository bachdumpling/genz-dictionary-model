7205611219942755626,Nah this one I totally disagree. If you allow tantrums these kids will abuse you.
7205611219942755626,Thank you!! tantrum city over here. Just sit it out. Breathe. But fark it's hard. My parents would've wasted me I don't want that for my kids.
7205611219942755626,So what should I do?
7205611219942755626,Ok but give me 3 things to DO when they are having a tantrum
7205611219942755626,Easier said than done. 😭😭😭😭
7205611219942755626,"""They don't have the power to send you over the edge, you have the ability to bring them back!"" That statement right there is powerful!"
7205611219942755626,I saw a video of a dad just being present when his child was having a tantrum. He eventually calmed and they worked through it. It works with my child
7205611219942755626,"They are unable to regulate their emotions alone. Be their sense of calm, always."
7205611219942755626,Ice cream
7205611219942755626,I don’t know my parents told me to fix my attitude before they fixed it for me.
7205611219942755626,Great advice 🙏🏽
7205611219942755626,BS on “Connection.” That’s what makes them comfortable enough to keep doing it
7205611219942755626,"This 🙏🏽
""I hear you, love. You are safe. Tell me when you're ready"" is my go to. And when she is ready, she will talk and tell me what is wrong ❤️"
7205611219942755626,Every parent should read the book The Whole Brain Child. It explains everything this dudes talking about. It’s facts.
7205611219942755626,can we cry with them?
7205611219942755626,couldn't agree more.. my favorite thing to do with my son is take deep breaths together. 100% helps
7205611219942755626,"I find distraction is the key in these moments. It could be as simple as something shiny, or a toy, or an animal out the window. Keep calmly trying."
7205611219942755626,Nah. Hard disagree 😂
7205611219942755626,"""They don't have the power to send you over the edge, but you have the power to bring them back."" ❤️We're the strong part here, be with them ❤️"
7205611219942755626,Kids have big emotions and they don’t know how to handle them! Don’t punish them for having feelings!!!!

7225759716830383403,So the first girl did not have “the checklist he was looking for” but after the second date he wanted someone who was “more than just a checklist”???

7225760079990099242,i thought i was the only one who noticed she has really changed if you watch i am Georgina she has so much pride n treats her friends like servants.
7225760079990099242,"Nah If the 🐐’s mom could marry him, she would. She don’t like no girl near her son so that’s not soy Georgina’s fault 😭"
7225760079990099242,Yeh all she does is show off her luxury yet it’s ronaldos money 😏

7207166909480160558,It literally doesn’t make any sense either way if one of his employees mess up they’re always gonna want to speak to a manager or the owner lol
7207166909480160558,he doesn't even know what he's talking about
7207166909480160558,ya sure 1099 taxes that probably why

7207166909480160558,Basically he’s the middle man
7207166909480160558,Maybe cuz I don’t know…I don’t think either know 😅 I feel like I’m hearing my lil cousins talk
7207166909480160558,He’s got a future in politics
7207166909480160558,This doesn’t compute
7207166909480160558,SMH notice he didn’t answer the question just sounded very SIMPLE

7224218986639150382,Buncombe County won’t let us use toilet 90s no more because “flanges are designed to go inside” 4 inch.
7224218986639150382,Dude....you busted the flange when you took out the middle piece!!!!!
7224218986639150382,them inside pipe cutters best thing ever

7216471943678233902,Glidden's is even better. I've tried both and Rust-Oleum fades in direct sun light and Glidden's didn't
7216471943678233902,How did you know I was just shopping for new cushions. Now I will shop for paint 🤣
7216471943678233902,wondering if I can use it on the outdoor umbrella
7216471943678233902,My cushions are a strange size. I haven’t been able to replace them. This would be great! TY
7216471943678233902,Are the stiff? Do they crack? What does it really feel like to sit on them? Cost?
7216471943678233902,How do they feel?
7216471943678233902,Does it make the fabric hard?
7216471943678233902,Is it hard? Like make the surface rough?
7216471943678233902,Does it feel like a cushion still or feel like paint on a cushion? is it like a dye?
7216471943678233902,If there are stains it enhances them
7216471943678233902,i hated it. made cushions hard and took alot of paint
7216471943678233902,What! 😳Where can buy that? 🤔
7216471943678233902,Did u seal them ?
7216471943678233902,I didn’t know you can’t spray paint cushions.. how odd but I guess they work well?
7216471943678233902,don't do it. the paint stays tacky
7216471943678233902,"I tried that once, and it did not work well for me at all"
7216471943678233902,I was just shopping for cushions today.
7216471943678233902,BUT do they FEEL like horrible plastic now???
7216471943678233902,Here I am thinking I need to replace my cushions. Thanks for this!!!

7202779351778102571,This is my most cancel-able take I’m glad someone else agrees
7202779351778102571,Plz I used to be obsessed with the VS fashion show I was so sad when it ended
7202779351778102571,I get this but when i heard Romee strijd lost her period and was scared she couldn’t have kids from under eating I felt so bad 😩
7202779351778102571,I LOVED how over the top it was and how pretty the costumes were
7202779351778102571,Girl it didn’t get cancelled because people “felt bad” it was because the company has been losing money for years and they can’t afford it😭😭😭
7202779351778102571,nah girl I remember being in college and watching girls in my dorm STOP EATING after watching the VS fashion show for like a week.
7202779351778102571,Hard agree. I know it’s not realistic for everyone to be 6 foot tall beautiful skinny models. That’s what made it fun!
7202779351778102571,Yessss!! I miss the vs angels! It made VS special!
7202779351778102571,"I will never understand why people just didn’t watch it if it bothered them, I don’t wanna see it so I don’t watch it."
7202779351778102571,YES! Like no other swimwear or underwear shows got cancelled🥺
7202779351778102571,The stopped mainly because it didn’t make sense money wise anymore. The show barely had any impact on sales and it was like $20 mil every time lmao
7202779351778102571,It just lost mass popularity and wasn’t profitable. Make the audience want to watch it and they will probably bring it back
7202779351778102571,i miss the vs shows so much 🥺
7202779351778102571,It was cancelled due to vs losing market share to other brands and the ties to epstein it wasn’t cancel culture it j wasn’t making money
7202779351778102571,"I’m 5’6, & my dream has always been to be a pro basketball player. Cancel basketball because I can never play 😭"
7202779351778102571,"I miss it, VS fashion shows WERE MY SUPER BOWL"
7202779351778102571,"i loved the show but i’m not adamant on bringing it back with the rumors of how badly treated they were, and the expectations they were held up to"

7219135061713636651,Great thoughts… I think you should have shown some of the great outfits so people could see it through your video … so maybe do a part 2? x
7219135061713636651,No bc SHAHRUK KHAN was there like what
7219135061713636651,i’m still stuck on the part that our culture was compared to PANEM? like what 😨
7219135061713636651,There was a video of srk eating in the background of an influencer’s vid & a comment said they truly don’t know who they’re in the presence of
7219135061713636651,How people were able to look anywhere else but at SRK will forever be a mystery to me.
7219135061713636651,They had RAJINIKANTH I didn’t even know until a few days ago this is so messed up
7219135061713636651,you are 100% right!! jack’s comment about PANEM literally baffles me because the Met Gala happens every year but no one has ever made a comment
7219135061713636651,LITERALLY BRO
7219135061713636651,I’m not desi and I’m shocked these media outlets left out someone like SHAH RUKH KHAN?! Come on now.
7219135061713636651,I’m not Indian & I 100% agree. I love Indian movies & love the culture!! I’m big fan of SRK. Wish they showed all the Indian actors/actress as well!!
7219135061713636651,THIS. never sit right with me and this is why
7219135061713636651,"The most I heard about actual Desi people was when somebody talked about a designer, they didn’t even say their name they just said a Desi designer 😑"
7219135061713636651,Thank god you said this. And everyone non desi saying zendaya and Gigi were the best dressed. Like I’m sorry what? Microaggressions
7219135061713636651,yep yep yep
7219135061713636651,YUP. Why was Zendaya front and center at this event? 🤨
7219135061713636651,And people is other videos comments defending jack is just baffling to me🙄 thanks for making this video🥰 also the eyeshadow is just🤌🏻
7219135061713636651,The way I didn’t even know SRK was there for the longest time and was like “is Priyanka the only Desi celeb there?” is a crime
7219135061713636651,this!🔥
7219135061713636651,Extremely well said!!! It’s absolutely ridiculous the way the press did this
7207835753739472174,Throw the whole brother away
7207835753739472174,show us the picture of the dog in his truck as revenge 😂

7207835753739472174,"That’s something my brother would do, I fully support your decision in the silent treatment. Lol"
7207835753739472174,"If Sam really loves you, don’t ghost him, too. Let’s get him his own phone. 😆🐶"
7207835753739472174,6 weeks is not long enough. He owes you big time😅😅
7207835753739472174,Time to go get your nephew. 😏
7207835753739472174,Never mess with the free dog sitter
7207835753739472174,Ghosting him is an absolutely appropriate response for that kind of stunt.
7207835753739472174,snail mail him the therapy bills. I'd have been HYSTERICAL.
7207835753739472174,"Ghost him. But if u wanna go the extra mile, if he has a key to your place, set it up to look sus too if he goes look for you. Scare him back."
7207835753739472174,Lol siblings
7207835753739472174,My brother asked me to watch his while he was in PA. She’s been here 6 years now. I think she’s ours now 😂
7207835753739472174,"next time he leaves town and you watch the dog, ask your brother if he came back a day early and took sam."
7207835753739472174,that's a fantastic brother
7207835753739472174,Buy some Ring and you will know where the dog/brother is…🤔🤷🏻‍♀️
7207835753739472174,Ya— brother is out for me.
7207835753739472174,I'm sorry but that is such a brother thing to do!

7193143834316983595,Bakers should have made cutting instructions cards or something bcuz most ppl wouldn’t assume that it should be cut that way

7193143834316983595,"If I ever gave anyone that small piece of cake, I would be ashamed. And you should be as well for even suggesting it."
7193143834316983595,Cheap way of giving out cake.. small slices .. I want a real slice of cake
7193143834316983595,"Cut the other people piece like that, but give me the pie slice"

7193143834316983595,For nothing? It’s still gone get ate lol.
7193143834316983595,"I just learned to cut it this way. If there isn't that many people, pie slices are fine. But, more people, than yes I will do this."
7193143834316983595,You’re not trying to fill them up on cake. GREAT JOB cutting ma’am Thank you for sharing
7193143834316983595,Curious does this still stand for surprise center (piñata) cakes?

7224936243585404186,"нужно оставаться человеком,как бы тебя не ломали,как не делали больно. оставайтесь людьми("
7224936243585404186,фактишь
7224936243585404186,я такого не можу робити...
7224936243585404186,"ну я так робити не буду тому, що до мене відносяться нормально"
7224936243585404186,"это работает только если относиться так к тем кто относился так к тебе, но не ко всем."
7224936243585404186,И так по кругу. Не вижу тут правильных слов
7224936243585404186,всесе
7224936243585404186,"я так делаю, но они начинают обижаться, бож"
7224936243585404186,А помоему так делают только девушки
7224936243585404186,"Плохие люди ломают хорошых, потом сломанные ломают других хороших людей."
7224936243585404186,"а что делать если тебе не разу не отказали в отношениях ? И ты первая ломала своих бывших, и даже если он был хорошим по отношению к тебе"
7224936243585404186,В любых ситуациях нужно оставаться человеком
7224936243585404186,По этому ровно все что здесь написано это так как ко мне относились полтора года и скажу есть такие же и девочки
7224936243585404186,другие хорошие люди не заслуживают такого отношения. они не обязаны отвечать за грехи других людей. постепенно все станут такими же злобными обмженкам
7224936243585404186,"ХАХАХАХ,он сказал чтт хочет расстаться когла я начала так же к нему относиться)"
7224936243585404186,А если попадется тот парень который этого не делал ?
7224936243585404186,если человек к тебе с душой зачем к нему относится так как относились к тебе раньше если этот человек достоин лучшего?
7224936243585404186,Для чего?
7224936243585404186,это нужно с теми кто делает тебе больно а не с людьми которые хорошо к тебе относятся

7223844016889007403,I swear Bruno mars is Michael Jackson
7223844016889007403,Bro sound almost the same
7223844016889007403,Nah it just sounds like a sped up version. Hiw about a non Bruno Mars or The Weekend songs for the Michael Jackson AI?
7223844016889007403,Nahhh hed be way more aggressive
7223844016889007403,ai can't replicate the same passion in his voice
7223844016889007403,NO WAY?!!!!
7223844016889007403,Now have Bruno sing a micheal song
7223844016889007403,when are we getting j cole on painting pictures
7223844016889007403,Please let me be first HAHAHAHA
7223844016889007403,I miss some hiii hiiii after every sentence from michael
7223844016889007403,I love your videos. can you try to do post Malone doing this song
7223844016889007403,"it's not complete without his ""yiihee...!!!"""
7223844016889007403,full version
7223844016889007403,are you sure that’s Michael Jackson? cause it sound like Bruno Mars
7223844016889007403,do more Bruno Mars' song and make it AI Michael Jackson
7223844016889007403,i really enjoyed this love MJ 🥰
7223844016889007403,A remix featuring Mj would have been amazing! 😭💕
7223844016889007403,The voice is just the same and the only difference is their accent.
7223844016889007403,I'd love to hear someone who sounds like MJ and cover other songs with MJ's signature sounds like hee hee and that sound like he's gulping.
7223844016889007403,"no MJ has a signatures AI can't replace, bruno's voice and MJs voice had a similar tone so easy for AI to duplicate it."

7223390659531623726,i want to like aperol spritz SO badly but i just cant
7223390659531623726,"Aperol Spritz is a drink that tastes better the more youve had, love it"
7223390659531623726,Hugo or Limoncello spritz is so much better 😮‍💨
7223390659531623726,Aperol spritz looks better than it tastes and I am ashamed that I try to convince myself everytime its good and still fall for it that it tastes bad
7223390659531623726,"you should try hugo spritz, it’s way better 😄"
7223390659531623726,Limoncello Spritz for me not a fan of Aperol can’t wait for that taste of summer again😂
7223390659531623726,We know the vibes well 😌
7223390659531623726,For those who don’t love Aperol but love the idea of it… try a Cappelletti Spritz… gamechanger

7223390659531623726,"Getting emotional to see this, considering aperol spritz was just introduced to the us the year I moved here 7-8 years ago🥹"
7223390659531623726,I feel like the same people that think cilantro tastes like soap also don’t like aperol… 😂
7223390659531623726,@Elizabeth Haughey I didn’t have enough over summer 🥲
7223390659531623726,I’m in the portion of the population whose palate makes Aperol Spritz taste like Lysol so I can’t relate to this
7223390659531623726,These don’t even get me lit I just be drinking them for the aesthetic 😂
7214922065487334702,So it begins 💀

7224855677120843034,Sanaa played this role so good that I didn’t start back liking her until last year 😭
7224855677120843034,How she mad at her mama for what her dad did ☠️
7224855677120843034,“where did i go wrong with you”
7224855677120843034,She let her childhood trauma destroy her adulthood
7224855677120843034,No lie this was Tyler Perry's best work EVER with the family that preys. he should've made this into his tv spin-off.
7224855677120843034,The Family That PREYS
7224855677120843034,he infact did Not marry her
7224855677120843034,She wasnt trying to convince them she was trying to convince herself bc deep down she knew 😭
7224855677120843034,she became the one thing she hated most 😂
7224855677120843034,the fact she wanted to do that to someone else and some kids like she don’t kno the pain is insane
7224855677120843034,How you get em is how you lose em 🙆🏾‍♀️
7224855677120843034,Her momma tried to warn her but she was in her own little world 😭😭😭😭
7224855677120843034,These Tyler Perry movies were eatinggggg
7224855677120843034,so why she want to be apart of that? she wants him to leave his family and leave them broke w no support?
7224855677120843034,It’s never the absent parents fault
7224855677120843034,This is how 80% of my generation looks like. Clinging onto men that don’t love them- that aren’t loyal to them. Just a bunch of side pieces… 🥺
7224855677120843034,"Funny enough, he was actually going to marry her. But he didn’t have a prenup with the first wife.😂"
7224855677120843034,Her Karma was so satisfying at the end cus she deserved it!
7224855677120843034,and....... she enjoyed the ride😂

7216002989528485166,"Neurosurgeon here. Do not underestimate spine surgery. I am not talking about simple discectomy. The magic starts with spinal cord, cancers or AVM."
7216002989528485166,Internal medicine residents are the backbone of the American healthcare system and the amount of work and exploitation they go through is insane!
7216002989528485166,"you really had EM and IM in here over Gen Surg and CT? idk abt that bro. 😂. Hell, i think Gen Surg might be harder than Ortho"
7216002989528485166,What about cardio thoracic surgery?
7216002989528485166,You are a plethora of knowledge I really appreciate you sharing all of this. Thank you so much.
7216002989528485166,"I’d move ortho up and add gen surg. And take EM and IM off the list, especially since those residencies are only 3 years"
7216002989528485166,EM here. Def work less than most other residents. But every hour of work..is physical/mental work. I often don’t sit/eat/drink/bathroom entire shift.
7216002989528485166,Vascular surgery?
7216002989528485166,Top 5 are all surgical I’m sorry
7216002989528485166,No one’s seeing 8/10/12 patients an hour in EM 😂 that’s impossible
7216002989528485166,What are the easiest residencies in your opinion?
7216002989528485166,Fair assessment. Would either add Gen Surg or replace EM.
7216002989528485166,What’s your opinion on plastic surgery residency?
7216002989528485166,Let me help you out. Replace EM with general surgery and your list is valid.
7216002989528485166,How in the world do you not include general surgery ???
7216002989528485166,Everyone has opinions…… but EM over gen surg?🤷🏼‍♀️I don’t think so
7216002989528485166,A cardiology fellowship would fit in here. I agree with the overall take from the creator.
7216002989528485166,That’s for the respect for EM!!
7216002989528485166,Thank you

7221749662217293098,Great now I’ll be more insufferable watching LOTR with anyone
7221749662217293098,That is beyond cool. This is why these movies are perfect. The amount of effort from Peter Jackson and his crew is astonishing.
7221749662217293098,aaand thats why lotr movies are some of the best ones ever made 😇
7221749662217293098,I like how peter jackson mobilised the entire country to make his movies
7221749662217293098,That’s why it sounds so creeepy!!!
7221749662217293098,Adding “voice actor” to my resume 🫦
7221749662217293098,practical effects for the win once again
7221749662217293098,That’s so cool. The crowd must have been so excited. Or not known what was going on😂
7221749662217293098,I now have another LOTR fact that I can point out to the disinterested girl I forced to watch with me
7221749662217293098,I had a lot of fun with this fact thank you
7221749662217293098,BUT MY LORD THERE IS NO SUCH FORCE
7221749662217293098,"I always hear ""Burn to, Ashes!"" 😂"
7221749662217293098,I feel so lucky to have lived when these released
7221749662217293098,"""Durbgu Nazg-shu, Durbgu Dash-shu"" means ""Lord of the Ring, Lord of the Earth"" in Black Speech"
7221749662217293098,Fun fact: they actually hired real Orcs for this
7221749662217293098,that's so dope
7221749662217293098,Ohh a new LOTR fact to tell while watching the movie
7221749662217293098,Adding more reasons why I love these movies.
7221749662217293098,"they did similar for TRON: Legacy. Had a convention hall full of people chanting for ""Rinzler"" and ""De-Rez"" for the Games."
7221749662217293098,This is gonna be awesome info for the next time I force my family to watch the movies with me again 🤣
7206120913350298926,I’m so close to joining this bracket. Just need another $30 Million.
7206120913350298926,I’m closer to a net worth of 30 million than Elon musk is 💪
7206120913350298926,$30M is a big number but tbh it seems astonishingly low to be considered ultra high net worth
7206120913350298926,I just need my parlay to hit
7206120913350298926,For me the point of having that much wealth is to avoid other people
7206120913350298926,I wonder what they taste like?
7206120913350298926,Houston rodeo in late February early March. After the Daytona 500. Then the monster truck rally then trout fishing in Wyoming early spring
7206120913350298926,"It’s wild to think that 90% of that 297k cannot afford most of the yachts at the yacht show. Even in this group, an even smaller group rules."
7206120913350298926,You missed the Catalina wine mixer.
7206120913350298926,i live in augusta ga lol. during masters there is so much traffic. private jets constantly landing at the airport
7206120913350298926,or you could just give money to the friends you had before and now you're all rich friends together lol
7206120913350298926,$30M is not even close the high net worth. Starts at $1B today.
7206120913350298926,All while we argue about bud light. Keep sleeping.
7206120913350298926,"Ah yes, the beautifully horizontally compressed video"
7206120913350298926,"im almost there I just need
29,999,999.98$ more!😁"
7206120913350298926,Y'all keep using paper straws why thousands of billionaires fly their privatejets to all these places💀
7206120913350298926,There’s people out there with money that one no knows about
7206120913350298926,👆🏻 correct
7206120913350298926,just waiting for a ka payment
7206120913350298926,Sounds like a season of gossip girl
7203743176610434346,John Kerry also has to travel via private jet...rules for thee but not for me
7203743176610434346,that professor should be sued and have to give all that money back
7203743176610434346,FBI = KGB
7203743176610434346,I will never go to San Francisco and will continue to avoid California at all costs.
7203743176610434346,That should be against the college's policies and procedures. What lf that was a class you had to have to graduate? No way in hell.
7203743176610434346,This is my favorite news station.
7203743176610434346,"Professors also make you purchase their books for their curriculum, it’s bs"
7203743176610434346,"So, that professor was either banking or getting a tax write off. That seems legit."
7203743176610434346,"But that teacher who has $60,000 that goes to her account and she can give to Planned Parenthood and write off of it as a tax free thing."
7203743176610434346,Tenure is taken away
7203743176610434346,the the teacher how does that really differ from writing their own textbooks?
7203743176610434346,"Yeah as a former business student, if I had class with that lady, syllabus day would be my first and last day there 😂"
7203743176610434346,"sounds like our ""United States"" ain't so united."
7203743176610434346,Honestly with the last story I’d prefer their funding come this way vs taxpayers. It should be completely privately funded.
7203743176610434346,City of SF once told company I worked for that we had to change our policies so they could contract for svce that only we had
7203743176610434346,Love your videos. You go girl! ❤

7224312439037267242,there are men who jump over children to catch baseball's .... 😂 ... I would literally die if I caught the guitar pick of Taylor swift 😭
7224312439037267242,people are so mean FOR WHAT
7224312439037267242,Acting like they didn’t get mad at the Tubi commercial during the Super Bowl…😂
7224312439037267242,I’m so sorry I posted a similar video of me crying at her concert and would have been so sad if people were this mean
7224312439037267242,they’re literally so unkind. i’m sorry you got these.
7224312439037267242,men jump over each other to catch baseballs at a game. I've seen middle aged men physically fight over a 90s rocker throwing a shirt into the crowd
7224312439037267242,Mmmm. Your tears are 6 million percent valid.
7224312439037267242,"Taylor said she’s a big advocate for not hiding your enthusiasm for things. She’d be so proud, as all swiftie are! Frame that pick!"
7224312439037267242,"Notice how the majority of comments are from men, if they don't care about your passion why just not swipe down"
7224312439037267242,There’s no reason to actively shit on someone’s video when it doesn’t concern you. I’m so sorry this happened to you!
7224312439037267242,"people are so bold behind their profile pictures these days, there’s no accountability for their unkind words!"
7224312439037267242,"being a fan and loving something so deeply is such a beautiful thing, why do we try to make people ashamed of it. it's such a potent, special feeling"
7224312439037267242,"I AM SO SO HAPPY FOR YOU <333 women are constantly berated for enjoying things, but this is what makes you happy!! so never stop <3"

7223723906379812142,The narcissist mother.
7223723906379812142,Did you all notice that the mother is dressed like a black swan w/ the same kind of necklace/ earrings/ hair Nina wears? Her in black Nina in white!😱
7223723906379812142,she protects her too much and prevents her from becoming a woman but the cake scene I don't understand why it's not bad ???
7223723906379812142,I think the all bad character was her mom
7223723906379812142,my mom

7223723906379812142,The subtle detail of the way the mom does a little choreographed “ta-da” gesture like a dancer might because she WAS a dancer before Nina…
7223723906379812142,Bella Hadid mother
7223723906379812142,CORA?????IS SHE ALWAYS A BAD MOM???
7223723906379812142,i can never let this be me (not that i have any chances of this being me)

7221303250786503982,i don’t know why ppl r ordering prom dresses in amazon
7221303250786503982,first mistake was goin to amazon for a prom dress n the only thing u can do now is get it tailored
7221303250786503982,i literally just saw another girl order a amazon prom dress… why?
7221303250786503982,we’re we supposed to be like “omg they’re so wrong for that” ?? ISSA PROM DRESS FRM AMAZON 😭😭😭😭
7221303250786503982,ording it was amazon was the first red flag
7221303250786503982,amazon…
7221303250786503982,just need it altered and ur all good
7221303250786503982,you literally got what you ordered 😂 just get it altered babe !!!
7221303250786503982,If you can…. Since the waist and add gold details from Amazon or hobby lobby
7221303250786503982,Girl I would literally cry and die and roll and flip and beat eb on Amazon and report the whole website and have it all cancelled bc omg
7221303250786503982,it’s giving “crying in my prom dress” fr
7221303250786503982,it’s actually not that terrible. If you get it altered it would look so good!!!
7221303250786503982,noooo😂😂
7221303250786503982,Amazon seriously😭😭😭
7221303250786503982,Amazon is crazy 😂😂😂

7221303250786503982,amazon? really
7221303250786503982,get ts altered n youll b gzs
7221303250786503982,OO GIRL IM SO SORRY 😭
7221303250786503982,I kinda like it-
7223051843054701866,I feel like those who paid have the right to be upset ngl
7223051843054701866,ok but people r allowed to be upset
7223051843054701866,no reason for him to promote and headline a massive show if he wasn’t ready. He needs more time to himself
7223051843054701866,i started crying when he started talking ab ryan
7223051843054701866,dis man needs a longer break he tired of all of us🤦‍♀️
7223051843054701866,people who are saying it’s been 3 years are insaaaaane grieve has no time frame
7223051843054701866,It’s more the fact that he wasn’t ready and tried anyway and disappointed all his fans bruh it’s ok to grieve
7223051843054701866,he’s definitely about to take a even longer break after this.. I feel so bad for him
7223051843054701866,broo plus it wasn’t even his fault. coachella is mad strict with curfew. coachella is at fault if anything bruh
7223051843054701866,No fr and the fact that him and his brother used to go to Coachella. Makes it even harder
7223051843054701866,honestly if anyone spent more than $500 on a coachella ticket solely because of frank than that's on them because this wasn't a frank concert
7223051843054701866,Honestly at least he had the courage to show up I love him with all my heart💯💯
7223051843054701866,i feel like he thought he was able to do this . maybe last min it was just to much for him . grief isnt easy especially when the set was dedicated 1/2
7223051843054701866,thank you
7223051843054701866,i feel so bad for him. grieving is hard enough then for him to finally build up the courage to perform again FOR him. and now he’s gonna see everyone-
7223051843054701866,still doesn’t excuse the changes he made on purpose to get out of the show early. you prepare for months in advance and he literally said F everyone.
7223051843054701866,even if the set may have been disappointing or not good enough i’m just glad he was brave enough to even preform after 3-6 long years
7223051843054701866,exactly im glad i got to watch him on lives
7223051843054701866,"CAPTION!!!! yesss couldn’t agree more, if you can sit there and complain about it then you’ve never really experienced grief frfrs"

7220363953635921195,Ima wait till these kids turn 18 and leave so they can spill the real tea
7220363953635921195,Can a dirt bike fit in the camper
7220363953635921195,"I’d totally own a camper/RV but not with kids full time, kids need space"

7220363953635921195,If my parents make me live in an RV full time I’m definitely moving as soon as I could afford it and resent them for the rest of my life.
7220363953635921195,I would run away
7220363953635921195,Thanks for that extra space they really need it

7220363953635921195,one thing I've always wondered is why the camper back deck when there's all that ground right there.
7220363953635921195,will you get a dirt bike
7220363953635921195,Do you need supports under the deck to take the weight?

7219789523775917354,I don’t think Nike is just throwing it away. I think an employee is putting clothes in garbage bags and throwing them away to come back later.
7219789523775917354,"This going to the landfills everyday, should be illegal to pollute like this plus this could be given to orphans or homeless"

7210803786699263274,I live in San Antonio and there is no freaking way that any of the Riverwalk here looks like that !!
7210803786699263274,Waittt I thought it was Xochimilco!!
7210803786699263274,"As a San Antonian, thank you 😂❤️"

7210875844049259819,I’m so confused how they could go and get the case and screen protector for it before even opening it to make sure it works good first
7210875844049259819,Why ain’t nobody asking the price ?
7210875844049259819,putting on a screen protector is so stressful that i hold my breath but ain’t no way i’m trusting someone else to do it 😂
7210875844049259819,"she put that screen protector on so effortlessly,when I do it it's like looking into a bubble tea😳"
7210875844049259819,putting that screen case on costed more than the phone
7210875844049259819,She’s trying so hard to make conversation but they just refuse 😂😂
7210875844049259819,Why does she keep asking about the color 😂
7210875844049259819,She makes putting screen protector on look so easy 😐
7210875844049259819,Imagine paying 3-4x more just to install a screen protector 😂
7210875844049259819,yes they like the color😂💀
7210875844049259819,I think they like the colour
7210875844049259819,I would have never thought watching someone install a screen protector would be so satisfying.
7210875844049259819,Is she gonna change the color if he don’t like it??
7210875844049259819,U asked him you like your phone color 2 times he didn’t get the clue u where trnna talk to him
7210875844049259819,colored phones to just cover it up with a case
7210875844049259819,Pizza

7217113495442066731,Running from contact
7217113495442066731,the whole point of the offense is to not try to not get hit and defense is to hit
7217113495442066731,Comments def don’t know what football drills are
7217113495442066731,"To all the comments talkin about scared of contact, this is not a hitting drill at all the whole point is to make the defender miss you..😂😂"
7217113495442066731,In a real football game the offense job is to not get tackled?? So why would they try to get tackled in this drill??
7217113495442066731,Why u would u run into the defender?
7217113495442066731,all scared of contact
7217113495442066731,3 is the leading tackler on the team ain’t he?!?!
7217113495442066731,They supposed to avoid tackling defense supposed tackle offenses
7217113495442066731,offense supposed to avoid the defense so defense can practice open field tackling
7217113495442066731,Man they not closing space
7217113495442066731,Offense ain’t want no promblems I would’ve tricked like 3 of em
7217113495442066731,Good tackle 3
7217113495442066731,People saying running from contact like my bad not everyone in a game gonna run you over some people aent huge their just elusive
7217113495442066731,wrap up
7217113495442066731,that's why u wrap up number 40
7217113495442066731,shying away from contact weakens this sport i swear
7217113495442066731,bro😂 they gotta secure the outside then force him inside towards the sidline/out of bounds
7217113495442066731,Lol I’m never going with number 11 dawg
7217113495442066731,The whole point of the drill is not to get not get hit🤦🏽‍♂️

7226080597792378154,"They don't care, come to the office. Not about being productive it's about control."
7226080597792378154,Stanley knew before we did how vital working from home is now! I could never go back to the office!
7226080597792378154,It’s 😬 extremely 😬stressful 😬

7220667060555091246,Basic redstone logic
7220667060555091246,master swich is not master swich
7220667060555091246,It’s a 3 way switch not 2 way and having 2 master switches is pointless in this setup bc you can’t turn one off from the other
7220667060555091246,Why 2 master switch for same function?
7220667060555091246,"Master needs to be a 3 way switch, but otherwise a good representation"
7220667060555091246,You need resistors to balance the current so one isn’t bright when only one is on
7220667060555091246,"you built the master switches wrong. you need them like: line -- -- light, so either switch turn the light off when on and on when off"
7220667060555091246,"so I have a light on on my basement, it could be any one of 3 switches, possibly all three and I have to walk around to all 3 to turn the light off"
7220667060555091246,2-way switch. Do you mean 3-Way switch
7220667060555091246,"Both Master Switches are OC, how are the rooms getting power when the current is Open at the master switch?"
7220667060555091246,I can't see the use for this at a house
7220667060555091246,Do both Master switches on next
7220667060555091246,Try 3 way switches
7220667060555091246,single poles and three ways my guy
7220667060555091246,🥺

7224251681301597483,Yes but do u have tips for the girlys with lily scalp dry bottom of hair and horrible dandruff if u don’t wash every 2-3 days
7224251681301597483,"If you have a certain type of hair, it’s not bad to wash it every day if you need to. People with thinner, dryer hair don’t need to as much."
7224251681301597483,mine gets so greasy after day one
7224251681301597483,My hair will literally be trained then become immediately untrained the second I wash my hair two days in a row. Then boom greasy overnight again.
7224251681301597483,Guys it’s ok if you need to wash your hair more often! Not everyones hair is the same and “training” doesn’t always work for everyone!
7224251681301597483,i feel like i do everything by the book to not have oily hair and it’s STILL oily. idk what to do anymore🥲
7224251681301597483,i wash my hair every night

7224251681301597483,I was my hair once a week every Sunday!! 🫶🏽
7224251681301597483,I've tried going longer in between washes for months now. my hair is still just as greasy as it was before after day 1
7224251681301597483,i also go 7 days inbetween and it made life so much easier
7224251681301597483,On day 5 for like the first time in forever 😭🫶

7209969252697197866,Y’all trying to be smart makes it so obvious you missed the joke
7213110283043179818,Kinda throws us off when we repeatedly ask for help and support and yet it’s still our fault in the end. Quit blaming and start supporting.
7213110283043179818,"It's the way I'm expected to document every behavior fully, even when they are happening 15-20 times an hour. As if I don't have algebra to teach..."
7213110283043179818,I just HOPE you were a classroom teacher for at least 5 years before saying this 😂😂😂
7213110283043179818,This gives “Did you form a relationship?” Vibes.
7213110283043179818,How are interventions possible with overcrowded classrooms and lack of support ? Teachers are drowned by the system. We need help and relief.
7213110283043179818,I don’t have time to write down goddamn interventions I’m doing on all the kids that need tested. So many hoops and no time to jump through them.
7213110283043179818,"I don’t expect the school social workers or psychs to teach Calculus, why do you expect me to teach behavior? I’m more maladjusted than the kids."
7213110283043179818,Kinda like when we refer kids for t2 and t3 supports but student services never does anything or follows up
7213110283043179818,Until you have to deal with that child behavior all day while trying to teach rigorous lessons So that all students can master their standards😅
7213110283043179818,"between overcrowding, lack of support, and how much data is needed to actually get help for a kid in need it doesn’t matter because it’s never enough"
7213110283043179818,The way no one can show me a framework on how to implement interventions 🤷‍♀️
7213110283043179818,Go in teach for a month and show her how it’s done. We’ll sit back and watch
7213110283043179818,Tier 1 isn’t interventions. That’s tier 2.
7213110283043179818,"For me, it’s school psychs who have no classroom experience. With 20+ kids, while being responsible for safety, health & learning of the students."
7213110283043179818,This attitude is why there's such a division between school psychs and teachers. Start collaborating instead of judging.
7213110283043179818,In my experience LSSPs don’t take teacher’s opinions into consideration no matter who much data we collect.
7213110283043179818,We’re too busy cleaning our rooms up after they’ve been destroyed and catching the chairs being thrown at our heads.
7213110283043179818,I tried to ask which zone of regulation they were in between ducking a flying 🪑 and dodging a jump kick. 🙄😑
7213110283043179818,My love language is having actual time in the day and staff to accomplish this.

7216811710252944686,Akita said “ u on the wrong block homie”
7216811710252944686,That Akita was about that life.
7216811710252944686,Akita had that death grip
7216811710252944686,Akita are very powerful dogs

7216811710252944686,Akita's are hunting dogs tho? bro squared up the wrong dog
7216811710252944686,"Japanese use Akita to hunt bears in the past, a fighter is nothing to a killer"
7216811710252944686,"Also did anyone else notice that the Akita waited for the pit to bite, moved its head up and counter bit. That’s a badass dog"
7216811710252944686,Akita's are one dog pit bulls have no chance with
7216811710252944686,"Akita said ""I have 50 million power in Rise of Kingdom"" 🗣️"
7216811710252944686,Wasn’t a Japanese Akita bred to hunt bears 😭

7216811710252944686,"Just so you know, akitas are very strong and very protective when it comes to their family. They'd even kill for them and die."
7216811710252944686,Incredible defence to offence positioning
7216811710252944686,"akitas are breed to take down bears, trust me i had one and they are about that life"
7216811710252944686,Dude just sat there like this was everyday normal activity 😂😂

7221820964835773739,bro has to do that to 5 other bolts 😭
7221820964835773739,It doesn’t always work that easy.. z

7221820964835773739,okay what was the use of the channel locks?😅😅😅
7221820964835773739,Now do all that. Everything you just did. Down to the last detail… in space
7221820964835773739,I really thought the grinder was gonna work damn...
7221820964835773739,Hardest part is trying to take the reverse bit out of the bolt
7221820964835773739,I love the wrong tool demo's in the beginnings.

7212370584108485934,Expo markers take sharpie right off too !! ❤️
7212370584108485934,What about on fabric tho
7212370584108485934,i have sharpie still on the wall from when my 5yo (then THREE year old) decided to remodel the living room… maybe i should get some of this 😂
7212370584108485934,I love using this on our carpets!!! cleans great and cleans the yucky smells in the air as well!
7212370584108485934,Does it work for pen marks on upholstery
7212370584108485934,Use toothpaste to remove sharpie
7212370584108485934,"Baby wipes remove permanent marker, as well"
7212370584108485934,took red lipstick art off my brand new couch that my 3 year old at the time got out of my purse.

7212370584108485934,Is it heavily scented???
7212370584108485934,Does it work for crayon
7212370584108485934,Hand sanitizer takes away sharpie
7212370584108485934,Does this work on kids stained clothes?
7212370584108485934,"As someone with sense of smell issues, I HATE the smell of those products."
7212370584108485934,Hanson Tyser
7212370584108485934,hand sanitizer also works to get sharpie off things. you can draw over it with dry erase marker too
7212370584108485934,where can I order it for cheaper than 30$ for 8oz

7208751467442867498,"honestly that's still saying give them everything you have...nothing left for yourself. Can't do that, sorry. Find balance
Everything is temporary."
7208751467442867498,"When you are running near empty, take a day off. Don’t grade papers that day, go sit in the park."
7208751467442867498,Let’s normalize not giving them ALL we have. What about me? What about my son? What do we get? Zero? Nah
7208751467442867498,What’s left for everything and everybody else? This is what makes it unsustainable.
7208751467442867498,Some days. 5% is my 100%.
7208751467442867498,This the realest things I have seen

7208751467442867498,Yes sir. 🙌🏽
7208751467442867498,Toxic positivity! We keep getting told to give all we have! Why? What are we saving for ourselves and our families?
7208751467442867498,The kids need 100% of all you got. ❤️
7208751467442867498,"Huge advice because it’s really realistic to teaching. Life is hard, but we show the kids the opposite."
7208751467442867498,NO! NO! NO! When you have 30% you take a day or 2 or 3 off and forget the job for awhile. Then you come back when you actually feel better....
7208751467442867498,"Yes! I always tell myself, if I would grade myself at an 85, that's good enough for us all!"
7208751467442867498,"except no matter the percentage, if you're giving the kids your all then you're still left with nothing for yourself or family"
7208751467442867498,"I love the realness of this message. It is temporary, gain the necessary skills and move on"
7208751467442867498,This is the same rule I have for my kiddos.

7200476110595869998,I think some of the societal talk around manipulation confuses regular communication of needs and wants as manipulation
7200476110595869998,Doing A to get B isn’t manipulation 😭 that’s how action reaction works. Always. They don’t understand. They’re just scared and can’t help themselves.
7200476110595869998,I got told my newborn was manipulating me like no he isn’t
7200476110595869998,Literally someone told me that children & dogs can manipulate adults and that I should take a psychology class 😭
7200476110595869998,“they’re not trying to give you a hard time they’re just HAVING a hard time”
7200476110595869998,you gotta go through a million classes to possibly adopt a kid but if you DIY they're just like welp 🤷 good luck I'm sure you're more than qualified
7200476110595869998,Also older people who manipulate learned to do that because they weren’t getting their needs met…
7200476110595869998,this. my parents thought i was lying about abuse and manipulating them. i didn’t even know lying about abuse was a thing 💀
7200476110595869998,"Also if a older kid/child (that is not yours, like babysitting or daycare) is “manipulating you” it’s the parents fault, not the kid’s"
7200476110595869998,Bruh young kids don’t know what manipulation is but they sure as hell know certain things get reaction outta parents
7200476110595869998,"they act like things like attention/play arent needs and dont provide them then think it's ""manipulative"" when kids try other ways to get those things"
7200476110595869998,The problem starts when people dehumanize kids as things to be managed. They are ppl even when upset
7200476110595869998,You can’t spoil babies/kids by providing their basic needs!! I hate hearing about how snacks/holding a baby/etc. is gonna spoil
7200476110595869998,some ppl in these comments don't know how to read oh my lawd
7200476110595869998,"my heart breaks for all of us who were told that and are adults now, realizing we were never naturally manipulative, just in need of our parents love"
7200476110595869998,i was taught babies can manipulate moms by crying for cuddles. like HUH????? ITS A BABY. IT KNOWS NOTHING
7200476110595869998,"HEAVY on the learning about infant, child and teen development"
7200476110595869998,every time id have some sort of emotional reaction around my stepdad i would be accused of manipulation and of faking it
7200476110595869998,I took a human growth & dev class in college and the ENTIRE time all I could think ab was how many children suffer bc of the lack of BASIC knowledge

7208216921815223598,PTO = Prepare The Others
7208216921815223598,Don't live to work; work to live.
7208216921815223598,my pto and my employees pto gets approved automatically. idec why. I took pto because Hogwarts Legacy came out that whole week
7208216921815223598,if it's months in advance there's 0 reason for a denial you should ezly be able to make a new schedule. if you can't make one with months of time then
7208216921815223598,every job I ever worked I told them I don't do a point system and if I need a day off there's a reason and I'm not going to be there 😅
7208216921815223598,Thats why i love amazon PTO is automatically approved 😂
7208216921815223598,Should check your company’s policy handbook.
7208216921815223598,Rule #1 of how to get fired
7208216921815223598,Work ethic has gone down the drain so much it’s not even funny…

7208216921815223598,this is how I am at work 🤣
7208216921815223598,I told my job when I started “on this day don’t put me down on the schedule cuz I will not walk in that door”
7208216921815223598,Sounds like the conversation I had back in October about my vacation plans in April and she stilll tried to put me on the schedule to work
7208216921815223598,this is how I approach the topic. I do not need approval to take time off. I am selling MY time to you. you pay me for that time. it is MY TIME!
7208216921815223598,what's the point of personal time of off if you have to give the reason.
7208216921815223598,I just take the day off if I feel like it and I have the hours available.
7208216921815223598,Until 2 employees are off at the same time and they hire a new person to cover then there aren’t enough hours when everyone is back
7208216921815223598,"We went through PTO process during hiring, unexcused absence."
7208216921815223598,"took vacation to Galveston, told I'ma be off 6 months I'm advance, was called all weekend because someone quit and jumped me in line for on call"

7206203025663298859,I wonder if barnacles itch as bad as I think they do.
7206203025663298859,I will never touch barnacles. Never.
7206203025663298859,It makes my skin crawl to see barnacles on them
7206203025663298859,everyone be careful touching barnacles. If you have a cut and touch one or cut yourself on one it can grow on you! Apparently it's excruciating.
7206203025663298859,They def need to hit up Oscar’s whale wash where you get a hell of a wash and the price OH MY GOSH
7206203025663298859,Do barnacles hurt whales? I saw an episode of a show where a guy had a barnacle growing in him and he said it was excruciating
7206203025663298859,barnacles dont hurt whales directly but they do house lice which feed on the whales.
7206203025663298859,As someone who grew up on beaches and getting cut by barnacles regularly your not going to have them attach to you like this😂
7206203025663298859,CANT WE START A PROGRAM TO SCRUB THEM CLEAN OF BARNACLES? Lets jump in and help them!
7206203025663298859,my door when everyone at the house is sleeping
7206203025663298859,the fact it understood to come up more out of the water so he could get more off. wow. what an intelligent creature
7206203025663298859,I hate barnacles with my whole life
7206203025663298859,He actually moved when you motioned him too! 😍
7206203025663298859,Finally someone peeling the barnacles off!! Yes!!!
7206203025663298859,Whales breach usually to help remove barnacles
7206203025663298859,Ughh the sounds is so lovely
7206203025663298859,So amazing 🥰
7206203025663298859,FINALLY someone who picks the barnacles off instead of just petting them 🥰
7206203025663298859,Just get a mega sized cheese grater lol
7206203025663298859,when you told him to come here he raised up. that's amazing

7200772334620331307,It just wraps the tether around a baby seal’s neck and flies home
7200772334620331307,So basically it's going to be like fishing line but on land hanging from trees
7200772334620331307,so basically it's being holded by the thing
7200772334620331307,Smart design
7200772334620331307,"And then it marks the gps coordinates and someone collects the tether, or is it a litter bot?"

7200772334620331307,good ad
7200772334620331307,how about if I throw the line into the propeller
7200772334620331307,"so if I can catch the tether, then I get a free tether**"
7200772334620331307,So if I wanted to steal the box I could

7222365931190701355,Why are people saying 85k is a small profit? When is the last time they made a lump sum of 85k lol
7222365931190701355,When I first seen it and the price.. instantly thought omg you won wow
7222365931190701355,How are people saying $85k isn’t much profit? That’s more than most make in a years salary lol
7222365931190701355,New to all this so correct me if I’m wrong… but this doesn’t seem like a flip that was worth it for such a small profit..
7222365931190701355,Not me singing along with the song because this renovation got me hype 😅 I love it 😍
7222365931190701355,Wish everyone would put this much love and thought into renovations!
7222365931190701355,"The profit was about 85 , 86,000 so I feel like you spent more money on renovations, but 85,000 is 85,000"
7222365931190701355,200k for rennovations?! 👏🏽Amazing.
7222365931190701355,When I seen the 200k renovations I just KNEW this house was going to be beyond beautiful 😍👏🏾 y’all did that !

7222365931190701355,"85k profits but 200k in renovations, correct me if I’m wrong that’s a lost right? Besides that the house looks beautiful"
7222365931190701355,The bathroom floor 🤌🏻

7222365931190701355,🔥🔥🔥. Beautiful work!
7222365931190701355,That’s awesome. How long did it take you to renovate?
7222365931190701355,Do you all not know what a profit is. They made the money they bought the house with plus the money they renovated it with back and had almost 90kback

7222329438661299502,"looks great. fun to put LED lights under the rocks so u can change colors at night. After time, stain and seal and look like glass."
7222329438661299502,use mulch glue to keep the rocks down!!
7222329438661299502,you should use mulch glue to hold the little rocks in place
7222329438661299502,I saw someone glue their rocks down so they didn’t move out of place & it looked awesome!
7222329438661299502,Beautiful! Time to paint the house to match !

7203983125372751147,Everyone saying $23 as a tech. I was traveling and was making $36 as an aid

7201523528116620590,some people can't get a joke
7201523528116620590,I went through all 84 comments (as of 2:38 February 18th) and there is literally only one person who didn’t get the joke
7201523528116620590,They even included it in the Toy Story movies! What an outrage
7201523528116620590,Doesn’t bro realize those are Easter eggs put in there by the makers??🙄🙄🙄 he has it all wrong (i am the one everyone is commenting about)
7201523528116620590,why does the pizza planet truck keep appearing in this video? it only belongs in toy story.
7201523528116620590,Can’t believe people cant take a joke (im fighting invisible comments)
7201523528116620590,The American Sniper one is clearly an easter egg 🤦🏾‍♂️
7201523528116620590,"it wasn't actually a baby, it was a miniature pizza planet truck 😳😳"
7201523528116620590,I've never seen this many people mis such a blatantly obvious joke
7201523528116620590,Fun Fact: They aren't sure what settings they used when creating Toy Story so for every Pixar movie they copy the master file and edit inside the copy
7201523528116620590,"Silly Jack, this video isn't Toy Story, why did you leave in the Pizza Planet truck?"
7201523528116620590,Jack? Is this you? Is this all a simulation?
7201523528116620590,Brave was amazing
7201523528116620590,"Erm sir, it's a reference. It's not a mistake. I hope you will do better."
7201523528116620590,How could they mess up so many times 😂😂
7201523528116620590,"They can’t keep getting away with this, they can’t keep getting away with this!"
7201523528116620590,that only nine facts 😡 I NEED MY LAST FACT
7201523528116620590,@jackstiks WHO DID THIS 😂😂😂
7201523528116620590,Fun fact: the pizza planet trucks are actually easter eggs that traditionally appear in other Pixar movies.

7202409128512310570,dogfish next plssssss
7202409128512310570,I'm convinced IPAs are just the residual byproduct of real beer that is squeegeed through a drain in the floor and filtered through old socks.
7202409128512310570,“This already stinks” 💀🤣
7202409128512310570,"You're saying what everyone's thinking, bud. The courage to stand up to big IPA 🙏"
7202409128512310570,"do not stop this. ever. Unless of course, you succeed in there being none."
7202409128512310570,Wooden pencil dipped in lemon juice was such a perfect description
7202409128512310570,I’ve finally found my people.
7202409128512310570,I’m from the PNW and strangers punch me when I say I don’t like IPAs 😃
7202409128512310570,🤣 I’m led to understand that a taste for IPAs is physiologically similar to a taste for cilantro.
7202409128512310570,IPAs taste like old flowerpot water!!
7202409128512310570,I’m so glad I’m not pretending to like IPAs anymore
7202409128512310570,That was a good pour.
7202409128512310570,I love IPAs and this was super funny. Your sweater is very nice.
7202409128512310570,every IPA I have ever tried reminds me of that time I forgot my gym bag with dirty clothes in my car during a texas summer
7202409128512310570,This made me want an IPA
7202409128512310570,try Sierra Nevada extra IPA. anything from stone brewery is solid.
7202409128512310570,"I love IPAs, but I'm gonna follow anyways. You're not entirely wrong"
7202409128512310570,I love IPAs and I love this account.
7202409128512310570,I love IPAs and this video.
7202409128512310570,Do NOT tell my husband that I just liked and followed
7218731874255162670,"Wonderful idea but i dont think this will not work on all types of hair, just hair that's fine because coarse hair won't slide that easy"
7218731874255162670,"as soon as I attempt this my 4c hair gonna whisper 🗣""get somebody else to do it"" 🤣🤣"

7218731874255162670,Not for every hair grade
7218731874255162670,Itll cause breakage overtime due to friction 😅 but it is a time saver.

7194901546423897386,We use our salt for margaritas not the road and no one owns a plow. 😂
7194901546423897386,It will be 80 on Saturday
7194901546423897386,"this is exactly why the whole state just shuts down in this weather, we don't have the infrastructure to properly handle it. it's too dangerous"

7194901546423897386,It’s Texas we don’t have no salt 😂😂
7194901546423897386,Welcome to Texas when we have an Ice Storm they sand the roads no salt though 😳
7194901546423897386,Why buy plows and salt trucks to use 3 days out of the year?
7194901546423897386,We Texans already know..... it's something wrong every year
7194901546423897386,Texas does have snow plows but mostly only used north of Wichita Falls up to Amarillo Texas

7222740817864166699,"For those wondering, the song is called ‘Im Cal the Dragon’ by Cal the Dragon"
7222740817864166699,"Ironic how his name is Malachi, literally means “my angel” or “gods messenger” in Hebrew. Such an angelic voice ."
7222740817864166699,"I think he’s 13, not 30. 😂"
7222740817864166699,He absolutely deserved that golden buzzer
7222740817864166699,I’ve never seen Simon happier
7222740817864166699,He doesn’t even look like he’s trying 😭 he just lookin at the audience like 👁️👁️while he belts out rifts
7222740817864166699,dude looks good for 30 😁
7222740817864166699,It was like an entrance song to heaven or something 🥰
7222740817864166699,absolutely amazing. his mouth opened and heaven flowed out
7222740817864166699,He's also being incredibly smart and allowing the mic to amplify his voice rather than trying to belt it out.
7222740817864166699,"Just me, or did his voice make anyone else cry! 😢"
7222740817864166699,"I don't know what I expected, but this was not it. absolutely stunning ❤️"
7222740817864166699,HE IS AN ANGEL
7222740817864166699,He is already known in the classical world. He has sung as a soloist with choirs and orchestras. So happy is gaining a bigger audience with this show
7222740817864166699,"This one, we protect at all costs"
7222740817864166699,You know your good when Simon's just sitting there smiling.
7222740817864166699,"Is it me, or is Simon nicer since he became a daddy"
7222740817864166699,This is the kid who recorded walking in the air with Aled Jones earlier this year!?
7222740817864166699,"I was not expecting opera. holy cow, he made that seem effortless."

7199845091559607595,"you have to find the key combination, from left to right spuning sping 😂"
7199845091559607595,I had a guy do the same thing then he cut through the a arm to cut the bolt. Thank goodness he didn't get all the way through.
7199845091559607595,Dont forget it hits the tie rod end when you pull it all the way out😐

7222317964819729707,he only stopped the fight because he saw he was gonna die
7222317964819729707,"Turn the music up a little bit, we can almost hear dialogue and we can't have that"
7222317964819729707,"I need that power ""PAIN""😁😁😁😁"
7222317964819729707,I love the look Bella gives her.
7222317964819729707,It's actually kind of horrifying to know E&B's relationship checks every box on what abusive relationship traits are red flags.
7222317964819729707,is that blonde guy at the end Jamie Campbell Bower from stranger things ??
7222317964819729707,PAIN 😂😂😂😂😂 me imagining I come in and solo all of them😂😂😂😂😂

7198673185628245294,It should be illegal to own 96 income properties
7198673185628245294,Airbnb pushed themselves out. You can’t even have guests at airbnbs anymore & they expect you to clean before you leave + a cleaning fee
7198673185628245294,Or people are tired of fees. I’d prefer staying at a Marriott or Hilton.
7198673185628245294,airbnb is a huge reason why we have a housing problem
7198673185628245294,"I was a loyal Airbnb user, they got greedy, I went back to hotels"
7198673185628245294,Also tourists do not want an AirBnB an hour+ from Glendale lmao
7198673185628245294,They've gotten so expensive that a hotel is cheaper now. I'm not at all surprised.
7198673185628245294,You mean price gouging can backfire??
7198673185628245294,Tbh I’m sick of the list of things to do before I leave and then on top of that at least a $100 cleaning fee. Gimme a hotel.
7198673185628245294,Its probably the cleaning fee
7198673185628245294,Sell the houses back to locals
7198673185628245294,You know they are wayyyyyyy over charging
7198673185628245294,Phoenix has so many hotels.
7198673185628245294,Pro tip: Book a hotel
7198673185628245294,Good lol
7198673185628245294,How this guy has almost 100 rental properties is the most concerning part for me 😳
7198673185628245294,I’m back to hotels.
7198673185628245294,Let’s hope so! Nauseating that 21k homes aren’t available to actual residents!

7226101187500723498,Wasn’t ‘Cleanliness is next to godliness’ a popular Victorian mantra? Often referring to purity (morality) of mind and cleanliness of body.

7223605607222365483,"“I’m X and i’m ivy, and welcome to fact or cap”"
7223605607222365483,y’all worried about it dry i’m just worried about the $13 coconut oil she bought
7223605607222365483,But nobody is showing when it dries
7223605607222365483,"I thought when she got in her car, she was gonna back it up and get it scratched on purpose 😂 then do the hack"
7223605607222365483,Coconut oil cures everything
7223605607222365483,Only thing I’ve learned that take the scratches out of car pain is gasoline!

7224218986639150382,Buncombe County won’t let us use toilet 90s no more because “flanges are designed to go inside” 4 inch.

7226100448611093806,Where is Nigerian American?
7226100448611093806,I think the big thing is that our parent supported us financially to set us up for success. They know to invest for a bigger reward
7226100448611093806,They come here already wealthy educated or connected
7226100448611093806,Multi generational house hold can help prevent delinquency.
7226100448611093806,As soon as you mentioned red lining and social barriers I knew you were valid 💯 smart man
7226100448611093806,West Indian or Caribbean families too
7226100448611093806,(Higher members from the caste were also able to come to the states)
7226100448611093806,Most of them do overtime in their field
7226100448611093806,"point number 3 is the key. I am an african immigrant and my family is split into accounting & engineering. no music, no sports."
7226100448611093806,I live in an Indian neighborhood they don’t waste money on materialistic stuff and it’s a lot of them in one apt everyone works and saves their money
7226100448611093806,Spot on. When I was 19 I was taking max credit hours at University since I had no financial liabilities. Parents were supporting me. Now I support ‘em
7226100448611093806,In America when we turn 18 we: leave or our parents tell us to leave. I’m telling my daughters to stay home until they are married or graduate college
7226100448611093806,"This is very dope but it also fails to mention w/most foreign countries, only a small percent(normally educated) are immigrating"
7226100448611093806,This study was 10 years ago now its way more 😂😂
7226100448611093806,"I agree, focusing on education, having a support system to watch the kids, and marrying with your culture, which is less stress, is a winning formula."
7226100448611093806,"I think this is only HALF of the truth around this feedback. So many other realities are missed here, especially with business/entrepreneurship."
7226100448611093806,"Love these conscious answers! Love that you acknowledged the access to loans, funding, and housing oppose to other minorities 🙌"
7226100448611093806,Great analysis. You just earned yourself a follower
7226100448611093806,I watched his video but kept thinking financial success doesn’t equate to fulfilling purposeful life.
7226100448611093806,"our parents set us up for success cuz they came from 3rd world country’s, wonder how the stats will change with when 2nd gen have kids"
