having a manager under 30 i good bc you can have an actual conversation with them
"me, the shift leader, omw up to that register at 16 ready to gaslight customers and not let them get away with anything"
"im 18, fruity and a manager at my job, Had a lady request corporate on me yesterday :/"
Me when I was a manager for subway🤦‍♀️
“Let me speak to your manager” *Someone younger then them walks out* them: 😡😡😡
Why couldn’t I have had that at Starbucks or Dunkin 🥲 Just old hags who wanted to be corporate
That’s the best kind of supervisor
Im a manager at 18 and i don’t be letting these petty customers have they way😤
mangers under like 23 are the best bc they're not gonna give the customer what they want and they will talk back😭
Happy birthday manager!
Ahhh…I miss the Timmies crew
Happy birthday and w manager
Annabeth chase duup 🤨
happy birthday supervisor
"Ngl, the fruity supervisor with attitude that's still in HS would be TERRIFYING 😂"
"""but using Adobe podcast"" 🤖"
Keeping up w the speed of AI updates is exhausting
Going through the comments to find out what angles are
Can you make the last photo faster please. It was staying there for ages I practically was begging for it to move.
"It would be good to explain what you mean by ""angles"""
Mind blowing
ur editor getting fired soon 😁
That last part was dirty. Lol I definitely am not gonna be able to pause on that pic 😂
"Does auto pod only work with Premiere Pro, or is it its own software?"
"Adobe podcast is beta for sure, I actually found it only really working with overlaying the previous audio aswell on lower gain"
"AI can have my identity, I’m broke af"
will take the place of a miter saw for cutting angles?
Are they free?
So many new ai softwares it never ends
"what photo , that was too quick"
Descript has the same feature as Adobe podcast under effects!
"Fun now, but very soon, the only jobs available will be those to train the AI to replace the available jobs.😳 like a hunger game"
Industry workers really need to pay attention to whats about to happen…
They have to look this way. New shiny white Air Force 1‘s have to be worn excessively before they‘re beautiful. 😀
Yes cause it’s forbidden to wear clean ones when drinking 😂 it gets messy
Bro they look like they go out of their way to make them dirty 😭
This is why I wear black buffaloes 😭
Only dirty shoes in the club don’t want the clean ones to get dirty 😭
Never wear clean ones to the club 😂 it gets dirty so fast the minute you go in it’s gone

"You are so right
They be wearing them to 1% and saying they look fine"
It is definitely a pandemic here 😂😂😂😂
Somebody help us all 😂
"I’ve seen a girl at McDonalds in München with her AirForce destroyed, they had holes in them😑"

"no i completely agree..it’s not out of lack of trust, it’s because girls will be GIRLS. & bffr no girl wants there bf going to a party without them"
"the girls saying ""side eye"" are the same ones that are CRAZY in relationships"
u don’t owe anyone an explanation on UR relationship
"as you should, you shouldn't have to explain yourself 😭"
At the end of the day you don't trust your boyfriend because you think the girls will have enough influence to make him cheat on u
this girls my alex earle frfr😭
But why was he gunna go without you thooo?
"people are getting angry at u for living ur life and without knowing details, don’t let it get to you gorgeous 💗"
i don’t think it’s not trusting the girls more like trusting what your bf would do when a girl flirts with him when you’re not there
u shouldn’t have to explain yourself :(( people are so dramatic

"No matter what, India is not breaking up again. Whoever wants a separate place, may settle in the 2 pieces that were separated in 1947."
Unite rather than asking for a separate state.
Let’s not do this. Let’s learn to coexist.

Look at South Sudan the newest country formed. There are curently at war. Just because they get Khalistan doesn't mean issues are over
Thank you for this but you’re missing a lot of information.
All these people commenting bs here. Try and carry that much ammunition in Canada and watch what the govt/authorities do.
i’m sorry but what ab this happening in kashmir no one said anything
Interesting how you reinterpreted the 1984 military operation on the Golden Temple called Operation Bluestar as a “massacre inside…the temple.”
"I mean, im more for togetherness and less for a divide, it just leads to more hatred"
"he was making his own army apparently?
no individual in india is allowed to keep so many ammu.
how do they get these ammu??"
People around the world still so uneducated on this matter that why we are fighting for our own land. Read history first.
how they can suspend twitter accounts ?
"Yes, his methods are explicitly shown with all swords openly on roads!"
You left out alot of facts !
Weapons in India can be carried with a license
dialogue the only way to resolve differences
Why can’t we all just live in peace

Memories unlocked 😂😂
😅😅😅LOVE IT....!!!!
Thank you for this…it made a lot of our day today at work
I literally had this in repeat for 10 minutes.
Nah this one I totally disagree. If you allow tantrums these kids will abuse you.
Thank you!! tantrum city over here. Just sit it out. Breathe. But fark it's hard. My parents would've wasted me I don't want that for my kids.
So what should I do?
Ok but give me 3 things to DO when they are having a tantrum
Easier said than done. 😭😭😭😭
"""They don't have the power to send you over the edge, you have the ability to bring them back!"" That statement right there is powerful!"
I saw a video of a dad just being present when his child was having a tantrum. He eventually calmed and they worked through it. It works with my child
"They are unable to regulate their emotions alone. Be their sense of calm, always."
I don’t know my parents told me to fix my attitude before they fixed it for me.
Great advice 🙏🏽
BS on “Connection.” That’s what makes them comfortable enough to keep doing it
"This 🙏🏽
""I hear you, love. You are safe. Tell me when you're ready"" is my go to. And when she is ready, she will talk and tell me what is wrong ❤️"
Every parent should read the book The Whole Brain Child. It explains everything this dudes talking about. It’s facts.
can we cry with them?
couldn't agree more.. my favorite thing to do with my son is take deep breaths together. 100% helps
"I find distraction is the key in these moments. It could be as simple as something shiny, or a toy, or an animal out the window. Keep calmly trying."
"""They don't have the power to send you over the edge, but you have the power to bring them back."" ❤️We're the strong part here, be with them ❤️"
Kids have big emotions and they don’t know how to handle them! Don’t punish them for having feelings!!!!
"""Did you know her parents passed away?"""
And name of the movie pls
what’s the name of the movie
My cousins name is Hannah Scott
@ me for the next one
The ending 💀
this movie made me cry co much.
Next part please
I love this movie

Everyone knows what he wants 💅
he wants a man
He wants a Hindi speaker but doesn’t speak it very well 🥴 he’s in denial
He doesn’t want to get married and is making up excuses. 😒😡
Denial is a river in Egypt.
I know hindi swear words 😬
he wants a man
All of these ladies dodged a bad situation…
I dated him briefly. I have an American accent and can speak Hindi but that still wasn’t enough 🤷🏽‍♀️
Bro zestier than the onion ring sauce at Burger King 😂
“i love bollywood” “i love hindi songs” “i picked up on her being very indian” “i would like someone who doesn’t have an accent”
He said the date in the blue felt like an interview… he was the interviewer 🤦🏽‍♀️
set weird bar to hide in closet forever 🤭
The second girl was tooo sweet and tooo good for him!!!!!
someone who speaks Hindi but isn't Indian or have an accent? is he looking for a white girl? like I don't get it 😅
So the first girl did not have “the checklist he was looking for” but after the second date he wanted someone who was “more than just a checklist”???
'if anyone was a disappointment it's you' 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Plus cost of living in nyc.. I turned down Columbia for this reason too, thank god 🙏🏼"
You made the right decision AMEN NO DEBT
Rutgers gets a bad rep from people in jersey but it’s an incredible school and a lot of people outside of jersey recognize that!
YOU ARE SOO PRETTYYY
Columbia masters programs are largely cash cows. They don’t have class in the same way HYP do.
you are so smart for this decision and it is not easy to make. you will be successful wherever you go seeing how smart and real you are
so happy for you!
currently deciding between rutgers where i have an almost full ride and an expensive t5 school for my major and maybe this is a sign?!
"you love all your classmates, even the one who bailed during that final group representation?! 😭"
Lol me applying to dental school
pls pls talk more about healthcare administration because I want to do that but I am not completely sure yet
WHY I TURNED DOWN MY OFFER TO COLUMBIA FOR MY MPH PROGRAM!!!
You made the smart choice!

Everyone is Here at the Same Time 😂
Bro thinks he can take an 11 minute break 💀

ronaldo mom never gets along with anybody
i thought i was the only one who noticed she has really changed if you watch i am Georgina she has so much pride n treats her friends like servants.
"Nah If the 🐐’s mom could marry him, she would. She don’t like no girl near her son so that’s not soy Georgina’s fault 😭"
Yeh all she does is show off her luxury yet it’s ronaldos money 😏
Ronaldos mom is the problem cos she never get along with any of his girlfriends..
"At this point, the mom can marry Cr7. After 4 kids, she still won't get along with the girl?😳 She's past girlfriend stage at this point"
I really hope this isn’t real. I think Ronaldo has been through enough already
I’ve asked myself why I have never seen pictures of her and Ronaldo’s mom
Compare this to Messi who’s happily married and settled down with his childhood sweetheart
ronaldo’s mom doesn’t get along with any of his gfs it seems 😭😭
FINALLY I HAVE A CHANCE WITH RONALDO
Ronaldo saw hakimi case and wasn’t gonna fold RESPECT
My time to shine
It’s my time to shine then 🙏🙏 ( I want Ronaldo)
"That’s y bro never wanted to get married , he wanted to see if she would change"
Finally!!! After watching her show I am Georgina ITS ABOUT TIME RONALDO SAW HER FOR WHO SHE IS!
"If he hasn’t married her this long after she birthed his kids he doesn’t want to marry her period , years later too.. I believe it 🤷🏾‍♀️"
Ronaldo can’t keep a relationship 💯 ik my goat 🇦🇷
So called Messi fans hating are just kids who just started watching football and just judging from looking at stats and short videos🤦🏽‍♂️
ronaldo still hasn’t recovered you won’t know the feeling till it happens to u
Ik it bro ik he was struggling mentally I said when Ronaldo was playing last season ik he was struggling that’s why I was concerned
ima messi fan but i respect ronaldo n how hard he works
Makes sense why he fell off so hard after the 21/22 season
😢😢 poor Ronaldo he will win a World Cup
I’m a Messi fan but I give all my respect to Ronaldo for how hard he has worked ❤️‍🩹
Damn a hat trick
@GOAL why🥺
Bro fax people are roasting him even at my school but at least he is the goat😎
As a messi fan this is sad and the media kept saying sh!t about him and knowing what they are going through
Am a Messi fan but this hurts
no one is bigger than the sport show respect
they need to get married. sorry for them
A whole lot of talking but didnt say ishh
"I hire em per jah, whats the benefe of doin it like dah, the benefe of doin it like dah."
It literally doesn’t make any sense either way if one of his employees mess up they’re always gonna want to speak to a manager or the owner lol
he doesn't even know what he's talking about
ya sure 1099 taxes that probably why
He keeps more money
I do the same
omg so what if we finish it in 4 hours??
It’s still on you not them
Said a whole lotta nothin
he just saying he no longer has employees they are subcontractors
Basically he’s the middle man
Maybe cuz I don’t know…I don’t think either know 😅 I feel like I’m hearing my lil cousins talk
He’s got a future in politics
This doesn’t compute
SMH notice he didn’t answer the question just sounded very SIMPLE
"Exactly Business model. You get more productivity, peace work😁"

Them nylon bolts I just recently starting using them and I dig them.
Buncombe County won’t let us use toilet 90s no more because “flanges are designed to go inside” 4 inch.
Dude....you busted the flange when you took out the middle piece!!!!!
them inside pipe cutters best thing ever
ok...I saw the primer... did I miss the cement?
did you just flush that rag afterwards?
"Love the nylon Johnny bolts, they are a game changer"
left yellow towel in drain
I don’t like the plastic flanges. Prefer the stainless steel ring. Just my preference
thanks for sharing 👍
I like watching this vdo🥰
TAPCONS- My least favorite concrete longterm fastener

How did you know I was just shopping for new cushions. Now I will shop for paint 🤣
wondering if I can use it on the outdoor umbrella
My cushions are a strange size. I haven’t been able to replace them. This would be great! TY
Are the stiff? Do they crack? What does it really feel like to sit on them? Cost?
How do they feel?
Does it make the fabric hard?
Is it hard? Like make the surface rough?
Does it feel like a cushion still or feel like paint on a cushion? is it like a dye?
If there are stains it enhances them
i hated it. made cushions hard and took alot of paint
What! 😳Where can buy that? 🤔
Did u seal them ?
I didn’t know you can’t spray paint cushions.. how odd but I guess they work well?
don't do it. the paint stays tacky
"I tried that once, and it did not work well for me at all"
I was just shopping for cushions today.
BUT do they FEEL like horrible plastic now???
Here I am thinking I need to replace my cushions. Thanks for this!!!

Spiritual Warfare has been among us for a while now…the devil is now working through the children!
"Prepare me in Jesus name, build a hedge over my house and over my loved ones and over every believer who speaks and calls your name Amwn"

"She is not lying because there were floods, fire tornadoes and earthquakes that shifted continents. People ran to high ground but became trapped."

Edward Robinson feature 😳
Dude that’s so rad

Edward Robinson lore
"Babe wake up, new Edward Robinson lore just dropped"
was 80s bullying actually like this or just in movies?
one time a dude threatened to give me a swirly in third grade and I kicked him in the nuts and he was too embarrassed to snitch
or I just like their clothes🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
They just look good
Its all about quality man not showing off!
Maybe ppl just wear it cause they like the bold designs to stick out and not look the same as everyone they see
or someone who really likes fashion
I mean it could also be because you like to dress nice
Sometimes i like my stuff simple and something I like the designs. End of story. Not all people have two of those issues/options.💁🏻‍♀️
Cheap shoes hurt.
Totally agree with it!!!
WHERE DO YOU GET ALL YOUR INFO FROM !

Joseph smith looking up on us rn
most adventurous and exciting byu students
How they handle winter is a crazy thing to say
These are the coolest BYU students I’ve seen
Tbh not that bad answers
"Does she hate him or sum cuz beanie, height and ice cubes 😂"
this one’s like the most normal one so far
She described bro 💀
How they handle different seasons? 🥲🥲
The beanie stray was personal
"When people say you should see your partner in different seasons, they don’t literally mean different temperatures. It means different phases of life."
"""I'll have time with him later"" 😂😂😂 no hesitation"
No you aren’t 😡
Friend zone is not a nice way 💀
"Yo they always want different seasons like oh man if he is good in spring, he’s good for me"
I’ll have time with him later lmao
The blush wasn’t even bad

I’d watch your interior design show
Wheres the vintage versace jacket?🥺
Why do interior design tik tokers always have the most to say but live like this
Your bedroom screams broke college student! I’ll stay matching
"Ok but can we see how the room looks as a whole Vs zoomed in, I’d wonder if it all flows together and isn’t thrown together. Either way creative"
"I like your style, but I would’ve loved to see the whole bedroom in one shot!"
Can we see a full size view of your bedroom if that’s ok? so we can get some sort on interior design ideas for our own bedroom’s.
Please do this but for bathrooms!

"camping as a child was the BEST cozy experience for me, seeing their joy is so sweet 💓"
Cinching off an adult bag is GENIUS! Why did I never think of this
"Love winter camping and it’s a LOT of work with kids! Such fun memories, good Job!!"
when your kids are like 30 and can't sleep they're gonna think about this to fall asleep
I always remember being so bummed as a kid my parents sleeping bags were so warm and mine wasn’t so I could have Simba on it 😂
"That’s actually so smart tho, cuz then the bags can grow with them"
That looked like the coziest set up I want this 😂
Omg they’re all so precious. What a perfect set up!!! So cozy
Tents bigger than their whole room
i bet they sleep so hard 🥺
But whyyy lol
I have a kid size 0 degree bag from when I was little I hated it😂
"this looks so fun, those boys are making great memories 💜"
that's so..sweet..it warms my heart
I know for a fact that this is warmer than my heating that’s on full blast and that makes me angy
I wanna do this but at the same time I would be scared of soo many things and I wouldn’t be as comfortable
"Ugh this would be a problem for me. However, if Travis Kelce and I dated then I would totally be ok with it 😁😅"
Thank you for sharing your personal life 🥰🥰

It’s not excessive the raw fruit is so good for you!!
NEVER buy the precut fruit at grocery stores - a former produce employee (they use all the bad looking or gone bad fruit) i had to quit it felt wrong
Mam. I’m here to say that fruit is in fact healthy. Thank you.
"Fruits not bad for you, it’s natural sugar. 😊"
U cut off so much of the pineapple on the peel😂
Diet culture has gone so far we’re scared of fruit 😅
Fruit is healthy!
Puree the leftovers for Lordy 🥰
wait how was eating the core of the pineapple good for trying to get pregnant?
"I have a fruit dip recipe. 1/2 block of cream cheese, 1 cup greek yogurt, 1 TBS honey and 1/2 tsp vanilla. You can also add in a flavored water packet"
I love your videos you just say everything on your mind 🤣☺️
Are pineapple cores supposed to help you get pregnant? I’ve never heard of this
Looks good but a lot of work!? 😂
How much are you paying for strawberries 🍓 bc at the store today my jaw hit the floor at 5.99/lb
Where did you get your tray? It’s the perfect size.
Looove pineapple! But I became allergic after my son! 😭 that one looks so good
Love that tried this! If you didn’t want to chop I’ve heard big quantity style stores (Costco and Sams club) have cheaper fruit trays than regular
You van put the leftover fruits in to the freezer and later make a smoothy out of it

yooo bro got the GTA V license plate 💯💯🙏
Does Vatican city even issue license plates??
I'm I the only one saw the los Santos one?😂
The Irish plate isn’t linked to any car so possibly a prop plate or a mispressing
I will not accept the fact this man has a Tipperary plate
do you have Norway
Do u have a swedish one
South Africa NW province 🇿🇦
Norway or Scandinavian?
try finding a Arabian licence plate with 1 number💀
how about Iraq
Why'd u have a plate from Normandy 56 is the goat🐐
Do you have a dutch plate yet?
Get one from suriname
do you have one from croatia
This is my most cancel-able take I’m glad someone else agrees
Plz I used to be obsessed with the VS fashion show I was so sad when it ended
I get this but when i heard Romee strijd lost her period and was scared she couldn’t have kids from under eating I felt so bad 😩
I LOVED how over the top it was and how pretty the costumes were
Girl it didn’t get cancelled because people “felt bad” it was because the company has been losing money for years and they can’t afford it😭😭😭
nah girl I remember being in college and watching girls in my dorm STOP EATING after watching the VS fashion show for like a week.
Hard agree. I know it’s not realistic for everyone to be 6 foot tall beautiful skinny models. That’s what made it fun!
Yessss!! I miss the vs angels! It made VS special!
"I will never understand why people just didn’t watch it if it bothered them, I don’t wanna see it so I don’t watch it."
YES! Like no other swimwear or underwear shows got cancelled🥺
The stopped mainly because it didn’t make sense money wise anymore. The show barely had any impact on sales and it was like $20 mil every time lmao
It just lost mass popularity and wasn’t profitable. Make the audience want to watch it and they will probably bring it back
i miss the vs shows so much 🥺
It was cancelled due to vs losing market share to other brands and the ties to epstein it wasn’t cancel culture it j wasn’t making money
"I’m 5’6, & my dream has always been to be a pro basketball player. Cancel basketball because I can never play 😭"
"I miss it, VS fashion shows WERE MY SUPER BOWL"
"i loved the show but i’m not adamant on bringing it back with the rumors of how badly treated they were, and the expectations they were held up to"
ok but with inclusivity it would be SO GOOD LIKE I HAVE THE VISION IT'D BE SO GOOD OMG
Like I’m short I know I’m not being a model. Everyone needs to bffr
I agree I used to love watching the show every yr but watch the documentary on Hulu. VS kinda came crashing down financially w ties to Epstein too😬
"I’ve always been curious, where did the whole tradition of putting icons in such big garbs begin 🤔"
what is the title song plaese🙏
that was really fascinating to watch 👍☺️great work
ME CONSTA: CHISME DE LA VECINA
How could he not fall in love with the pretty sparkly lady
If she ever decides to become a parent I just know she would be the best
He will be a Swifty now
"Taylor swift is very beautiful and has pretty green eyes,,,"
I WANT HER PINK HAIR BACKKKK
Her cute little head tilt when she switched into child-interaction-mode
Taylor would be the most amazing mother (if that’s what she’d want)
i just watched that far too many times
How sweet that little moment was.
I think she would be an amazing Mom
I WOULD BE SCREAMING IF I WAS THAT BABY
You can always tell how beautiful a person is by how they interact with kids 🥺❤️
Love Taylor 🥰

"i think the moral of the story is, the first guy was mean to her but she didn't let that ruin her heart of gold and she treated the homless man nicely"

@😂😂😂@minthat441
I respect that owner for backing up his worker morals
The Boss protect his staff dignity. What a boss.
if I had a boss like that I would be loyal to him to the end
"he's a good boss, well done."
"No matter the language or the culture, you just know he’s handling his business with honor and respect…that’s how it’s done. Service is not guaranteed"
Customer is not always right😂😂😂
I wish more people would do that. ... This is a picture of a true man
That's a leader not a boss
"Thank You ,now that's a boss to work for !"
He's a good Boss. Respect for his employees is more important than the Customers money.
Well done we need more people like who respects their employees 🥰🥰
Super boss and great boss respect🥰🥰
"Mr. Boss, much honor and respect to you sir. Thank you."
much respect best boss ever
"Yes, Perfect example of you can not buy respect, you have to earn it. 😉 👍"
Omg the angle.! ..i thought the red thing was his whole back and his neck was somehow down to his knees😅
Straps were too low
River is wayyy to big for the jumper
He outgrew that like 3 months ago
River just turned into a water FALL lmao
I hope whoever put that together didn't put together River's crib 😳 they didn't even try to put the straps on right
they grow out of those things you know
River was rivering
River was there for a long time and he fell asleep😳
"I thought the red thing was a shirt I thought they fell out of their clothes too omg this is crazy 😂, on a serious note hope baby is ok !"
Lol pretty sure the straps go through the top not underneath 😅
When your boss walk in and you pretending to work 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The straps were not properly put on and the height was too low for him. Good thing he didn’t get hurt
Bussing up his bouncy seat!
went from river to puddle 🤣
Looks like the straps could be wrong too. Unless mines just different

Be grateful she asks. I just grab my bf’s food 😭😭

Always get the same thing and you don't have this problem

"at 9 yo I was playing with barbie no make up or skin care , or fancy stuff 😅😅😅😅"
In my country every family has a share bathroom 💀 we were a family of 5 sharing one bathroom
Gigi has more makeup than me and the 15 year old has more skin care routine than me
me sharing a bathroom with my whole fam and grandparents in a flat and they have it difficult
byoma skincare is AMAZING! i have all of those products
My hole family bathroom isn’t that big and we’re 6 people
so the mother cleans the bathroom and organizes makeup of a 9 y.o who is supossed to organize her things?
when I was 9 yo I was searching on YouTube how to make slime without glue
Where you bought the clear drawers organizers? 💓
I love everything about this and loved you respecting your daughters want to do it herself! ❤️amazing mom!
Why am I just realizing you are the skeleton dance girl!? 🤣👏🏼🫶🏻 love it!
whenever my mom cleans my stuff i get soo mad bc i don’t know where she put stuff but i appreciate her help but i prefer to do it myself 😭
The clear cloud shelves are to cute! 🩷🐇🤍🌷
The clouds are actually so cute
“She would bite my head of “ that got me laughing 😂
Bro she has more than me gosh I wish I was that rich
Bro I don’t even have that much 💀💀
when i was 9 we didn't even have a bathroom
Great thoughts… I think you should have shown some of the great outfits so people could see it through your video … so maybe do a part 2? x
No bc SHAHRUK KHAN was there like what
i’m still stuck on the part that our culture was compared to PANEM? like what 😨
There was a video of srk eating in the background of an influencer’s vid & a comment said they truly don’t know who they’re in the presence of
How people were able to look anywhere else but at SRK will forever be a mystery to me.
They had RAJINIKANTH I didn’t even know until a few days ago this is so messed up
you are 100% right!! jack’s comment about PANEM literally baffles me because the Met Gala happens every year but no one has ever made a comment
I’m not desi and I’m shocked these media outlets left out someone like SHAH RUKH KHAN?! Come on now.
I’m not Indian & I 100% agree. I love Indian movies & love the culture!! I’m big fan of SRK. Wish they showed all the Indian actors/actress as well!!
THIS. never sit right with me and this is why
"The most I heard about actual Desi people was when somebody talked about a designer, they didn’t even say their name they just said a Desi designer 😑"
Thank god you said this. And everyone non desi saying zendaya and Gigi were the best dressed. Like I’m sorry what? Microaggressions
YUP. Why was Zendaya front and center at this event? 🤨
And people is other videos comments defending jack is just baffling to me🙄 thanks for making this video🥰 also the eyeshadow is just🤌🏻
The way I didn’t even know SRK was there for the longest time and was like “is Priyanka the only Desi celeb there?” is a crime
this!🔥
Extremely well said!!! It’s absolutely ridiculous the way the press did this
Throw the whole brother away
show us the picture of the dog in his truck as revenge 😂
boys and their silly pranks!!! lol
"Tell him you can’t find your cat now, did he leave the door open?!? It’s just a kitten, he hasn’t even met him yet!! So cute, but you can’t find him.."
"That’s something my brother would do, I fully support your decision in the silent treatment. Lol"
"If Sam really loves you, don’t ghost him, too. Let’s get him his own phone. 😆🐶"
6 weeks is not long enough. He owes you big time😅😅
Time to go get your nephew. 😏
Never mess with the free dog sitter
Ghosting him is an absolutely appropriate response for that kind of stunt.
snail mail him the therapy bills. I'd have been HYSTERICAL.
"Ghost him. But if u wanna go the extra mile, if he has a key to your place, set it up to look sus too if he goes look for you. Scare him back."
My brother asked me to watch his while he was in PA. She’s been here 6 years now. I think she’s ours now 😂
"next time he leaves town and you watch the dog, ask your brother if he came back a day early and took sam."
that's a fantastic brother
Buy some Ring and you will know where the dog/brother is…🤔🤷🏻‍♀️
Ya— brother is out for me.
I'm sorry but that is such a brother thing to do!
"If the apps not banned before the 6 weeks, please update before it’s too late."

Bakers should have made cutting instructions cards or something bcuz most ppl wouldn’t assume that it should be cut that way
They always have me cut cakes everywhere I go. I could be dressed up and they will bring me gloves🤦🏽‍♀️😂😂
Yup yup I usually include cutting instructions
I would’ve cut it one more time 😂😂😂😂!??
But who made this cake?!!! This is the ONLY cake I’ve seen that doesn’t look dry ☺️🥰 I need one now ❤️
"If I ever gave anyone that small piece of cake, I would be ashamed. And you should be as well for even suggesting it."
Cheap way of giving out cake.. small slices .. I want a real slice of cake
"Cut the other people piece like that, but give me the pie slice"
We don’t want it like this tho 😂😂 too bad too sad.
nope. I don't get enough icing this way
I don’t want the middle slice .. I like my frosting 😂
They aint gone get no icing lol
What makes this way “correct?”
Nope order cupcakes 😂🤣
girl that's a sample I need icing on the other sides
For nothing? It’s still gone get ate lol.
"I just learned to cut it this way. If there isn't that many people, pie slices are fine. But, more people, than yes I will do this."
You’re not trying to fill them up on cake. GREAT JOB cutting ma’am Thank you for sharing
Curious does this still stand for surprise center (piñata) cakes?

when you see the spinning skull you know it’s over 😭
I was surprised until I saw the rotating cranium with glowing eyes
she won
Best I’ve seen is 148 how did you do this💀
This is oficially the highest score ive seen on this filter
highest score I've seen
An individual already realizes that the specific situation is concluded once they visualize and acknowledge the rotating cranium
one is aware of the absolute ending once he has encountered the rotating cranium with gleaming red eyes
highest I've seen was 150
HIGHEST IVE SEEN SO FARR
The Skull is lip singing to the song 😭
"YOU WIN!!! This is the highest I've seen, I've seen 148 but not 149 and def nothing above it"

He wants that visa
if she doesnt get into harvard i am going to get nowhere
harvard either is gonna accept her to get her out of yale or they’re gonna decline because they know she wants to go to yale
"white and harvard legacy was already enough to get into harvard, but rejected if they know that she wanted to go to a diff schol"
What do you think is the key to getting accepted to Harvard based on your experience?
Is it more Important to be unique and noticeable in essays or to have great stats and extracurriculars
Dream is to be ken carson?
someone lmk when part 2 comes
Giving me hope
why does income matter?
"I have no hope in life , L gpa no extra circulars and my parents are also broke"

What if u got picked for Harvard’s leadership program is thar good?
@Gone how do these people have lives

He served in black ops two
You can see his heart start pounding!
Bro did 12 weeks in call of duty and now he’s real life certified haha
"C’mon man, he’s not trying to steal valor… just looking for priority boarding."
"Dunno he showed the ID too confident and the video got cut, I think he proved himself"
vid stopped right as he gave id I bet he was in the military
“Here’s proof” - proceeds to show drivers license instead of CAC.
He served in Black Ops Infinite Warfare
Miami of Ohio????

All of that for 12 bars of soap - they must be like $100 a bar

And yes those were pearls
I think this kind of videos must be kept safe for future use 🧏‍♂️

My Pan kid makes jokes about coming out of the pantry instead of the closet all the time.
I love this! I’m an elem principal and talk about this with my friends often. Kids are so much more accepting. If only adults got out of the way.
my favourite thing here is he didn't judge him when he thought he liked pans. This makes my pansexual heart happy.
The fact that he wasn’t embarrassed by being wrong in front of you. I could never with my mom. She was very open but I would still be mortified
"As a pansexual, thank you for the laughs and the education 🩷 this was such a perfect conversation"
"I was raised in a family that didn’t talked about anything, so I’m nervous about my son asking things, because I still feel awkward"
"1. Guys, I know it’s DAD AND ME. If you’re not new here you know when my brain is tired at night, anything goes with words 😅 I’ll never have the"
We have this relationship with our kids as well. Sometimes the info is TMI but we’re glad they are talking to us about stuff.
And now you just told everyone mooooom!!!! 😂
I’m the same way as a mom and teacher. Kinda proud of your kiddo for breaking pansexual down to its parts and coming to his own conclusion…
Oh my god it’s like the stepbrothers scene “Pam. Pan? Pam.. Pan? Pam…”
I'm dying laughing because I was a chaperone there Friday and multiple times were told to stay out of that exhibit 🤣🤣 I'm open with my kids as well.
I love this so much. you are awesome.
this. this is the type of parent I want to be some day 😊
Love this 🥰
Yesss! I am 100% with you!
This is how my parents were. Pretty sure mom didn’t want to hear some of the stuff I told her. 😂. It’s an awesome feeling to trust your parents. 😘
I love this
"Bless them, people like that are the best 🥰"

What do you mean we introduced it to them via sheep. Did an Aussie mate with a shee and then the sheep with a Koala? Answer me!
"They might have filled a niche, but without any generalist behavior or alternative food source theyre not long for the world :/"
ok but twitter?
Loss of habitat is really their greatest threat
"I mean, Somebody has to do the job 🤷🏼‍♂️"
They are so cute
They have filled a niche that wasn’t needed…

"You're an excellent teacher! 👏
I love it when they say, ""you sound so white."" 😂
Much respect to you, sir. 🥰"
I’m sorry but when the guy said “I don’t want to talk to you” it sounded like Donald Trump 💀
“I SOUND LIKE A WHITE GURL!” * high fives*
The secret is not to avoid pronouncing the last consonant. It's not pronouncing it as a syllable.
“You sound like a white boy” 😂😂😂
why he kinda...
lol the cantonese he says is way more crude then the translated words xD
"""wow you sound like a white boy"" 💀"
The canto lines be off the chain 💀💀💀

Swifties are a different breed of crazy
im so mad i threw mine away from the weeknd concert it didnt occur to me i couldve kept it as a memory until after
My husband suggested this and kept his tab and I think I fell a little more in love with him for saving my bracelet
It’s been two days and mines still flashing….
"Just don’t use a plastic straw. But 70,000 random wristbands totally cool"
bro mine has been going for 3 days now i wish i kept the tab but this battery life is STRONG
"Also if they give you extras, make sure to use them at some point during the show or they won’t work after !"
mine stopped right when the concert ended 😭
Mine from Arizona stopped flashing right after the concert they all stopped😔
i threw my tab from my shawn mendes concert and it died 🥲
Mine is still blinking from last night
Can you take those? Do they not ask for it back?
"U can also use pice of paper if u accidentally threw it away, that’s what I did!!"
mine will not stop flashing lmao I need to find a piece of paper to shove in there
i did this for my rep tour bracelet but they just turn off after a couple hours :(
Good thing I saw this before it was too late 🙏

Mine was too yoenmi. I never tasted a rib eye steak and I thought I went to heaven.
"God Bless her. And coming from a family of beef producers, I agree w her fav food!!!!"

What about putting conditioner or oil on ends of your hair before going into the shower ?
"Massage the scalp, drink ur water, shampoo only the scalp twice, conditioner from ears down, rinse with cold water.. ur welcome 🫦"
Just realized our future generations are going to have really beautiful hair and skin because they have access to these info through these videos
I heard that wrong ~ 5 dudes you should be doing ~ but definitly held my interest 😅
"As a hairdresser, I absolutely love this and couldn’t agree more!!!"
I’ve been doing everything for a while and my hair just doesn’t grow. I’m broken
Hair products PLEASE
exactly what @ abbets said too! I'm going to try this!
I wash my hair with ice cold water and it’s the best feeling everrrr 😅
Would you reccomend using two different shampoos!?
I have short hair. My hair high is on my chean😶
when I massage I loose a lot of hair. my hair follicules are barely inserted in my scalp why
Can I shampoo twice even though I have thin hair ?
Zoe Saldaña vibessss! So pretty!
I do all 5 😿 except the daily message and my hair is fragile
How long please🥺🥺
Ok girl! Your hair is gorgeous.
Thank you for actually adding the ingredients in the caption! Making this tomorrow!!

"I'm sorry what everyone is going through but my family went in 2021- 3 days 2022- 5 days and never caught anything, I think ppl go already sick😭"
"I was probably 8 when I was at Disneyland and I felt so awful the whole day, turns out I had the stomach flu 😭"
Why escorted sorry to ask
got covid labor day weekend after being there and 2 months pregnant.
"For some reason every time we go my oldest daughter gets sick! A fever, every time!"
I've been dying to go this year but these comments are making me wanna stay away 😭
could it be covid ? I got it 3 times last year
"Went over 2 years with no one in the family getting COVID....went to Disneyland and broke that streak🥺 Anytime someone we know goes, they get sick."
My friend and I shared a turkey leg. I ate the majority and I was way more sick then her. We both were miserable. I missed two flights home
why are they escorting you out
I go in 9 days! Guess i am packing extra sanitizer
"Nine of us went the week of March 1st, 4 came down with Covid when we got home."
That’s how you start! Not jumping on a 600!
Are they all giants or is she just really really small

I feel called out
alright don’t have to call me out like thatttt
My home isn’t toxic but what is is when my mum gets so mad and screams and then smiles and continues eating as if it never happens
This but I literally can’t remember my childhood 😅
But it’s okay because the amount of failed friendships I have taught me enough now
You speak far to loud sir- (Just like my parents 🤭/hj)
"@ℳℯ ℴ𝒻𝒸 👸🏼 relatable asf, prob why I can't communicate with him.."
???is everyone this way
Don’t call me out like that

alrighty you don’t gotta call me out like thatttt
She’s me 😻🫵🏾
I don’t even remember the last time I’ve sat at a table and ate dinner with my family
Me but I'm not a 10
only table we had family dinners at was my dads place and that’s only cuz of my gpa but once he passed no more family dinners
No need to call me out
I don’t want anything but time and conversations with my parents
yup Facts
We are 4 siblings and we don’t want anything!!! Told my parents to sell EVERYTHING and enjoy.
"exactly i agree, i dont want anything only want to see my parents enjoy there life, they spent alot on us it their time"
Yup my dad died and he never enjoyed anything!
3 cousins are hoping for my aunt to die eventhough she gave each one a house🥺
Facts!! Show them how to struggle to learn how to appreciate 👍

I love anna bortion 🤭🤭
Guys named Marcus Hamilton naming themselves marcus Hamilton
why is the search Anna banana arched back pajama pants
One time I saw a username that was “annaplantain” and I don’t think I’ll ever forget it because that’s iconic
kids with no siblings naming themselves xXdark4ssassinXx
and if they name is Jake always gotta add the “fromstatefarm”
“Claire bear”
this the one
"Girls named Allie naming themselves ""alliecat"":"
That is the most true thing I have seen on this platform
Guys named Dan after discovering “the man”
For a split second I thought your pants were like a censorship blur. It looked like you just weren't wearing pants
Anne boonchuy reference
also british people named lana
what if your name is gertrude???? asking for a friend

No bc no matter how excited I am this would be how I react😭 and that’s why I will not be doing a gender reveal

They seem so thrilled 😂
They were like 🧍🏻‍♂️🌫️🧍🏻‍♀️
They look absolutely thrilled
Okay don’t be tooo excited now!!!

that was anticlimactic
They were less than thrilled
It looks like they just had an argument or something!! No eye contact or hugs or…. Happiness..

ngl i was confused as hell at first lol
their happiness wow 😳
they probably already knew at the doctors

"i do think this is such a good consideration as he focus to always have convo , and it could be dangerous for him and the guest"
i thought he was really driving omg
"honestly, that’s more preferable than jimmy actually driving. I don’t want my queens in a car crash :3"
I mean tbh it’s safer 😭 they’re literally distracted with each other especially him he’s always going all out during the karaokes 😭
Jisoo smiling becuase she knows 😭
i think he was actually driving with blackpink. bc they showed behind shots and they where actually driving but they had police escort
Its cute how lisa lil bit whispering to her to say a words 🥰🥰

How did Morgan freeman age so much?😭

"you could here the pain in the ""im sorry"" when he said it"
The tear in his eyes when he said “tell me you love me”
is this Morgan Freeman?
"Where the rest , we’re hooked"
The way I held my sister and cried not being able to tell her that her dad passed away was one of the hardest things I've ever done. Stays with me.

Zendaya said she couldnt hear anything bc of the screaming so i bet it was v difficult to perform like that and sound the best but she did great
Zendaya pops out and everyone goes feral SHE IS THAT GIRLL
THIS IS HOW I FIND OUT???
The fact that lab brought THE ZENDAYA on stage at Coachella is just WOW
THIS SOUNDS LIKE THE CRAZIEST CROWD WOW THE ENERGY
She said she couldn’t hear her self during the performance that’s why she sounds a little shaky in the beginning
The luckiest crowd ever omfg 🤭
TURN THE MIC UP NOW
I bet her mic was all the way up but that crowd gave energy 💓
If this isn’t the encouragement Zendaya needs to drop an album idk what else we can do. Girl just give us a lil EP
NOW THIS IS A VALID CROWD😩😩
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THIS?!
the way i would have shed a tear
Imagine if she sang Replay for the crowd 😩
this feels more like euphorella w dominic fike killing his performance too😂
All I hear is screaming haha
I hope ginny won't see this

prison school got me bricked up and laughing up at the same time
Prison school finally getting recognition 😭😭 (they sum baddies on bro)
Prison school has to be one of the most memeable anime I've ever seen💀
This scene is… I can’t even describe the level of dedication to the Bro Code this man had.
this scene💀💀
Then I say “relatable”
This specific scene in context is crazier than what this vid is about 💀
👈🏾 my honest reaction
that would be me
@josiahcanon14 “no one heard that”
Just saw 3 prison school meme scenes in a row on this app. Might have to go watch it now
Me in History class
@hugh context of this scene goes crazy
so diabonical that the assasin had to stop sneaking around
me laughing the hard as i can:
Everyone tagged they sibling💀
My sister is always ignoring me

"when will be the idd , Is it on Friday or Saturday?💗💕💞"
I swear Bruno mars is Michael Jackson
Bro sound almost the same
Nah it just sounds like a sped up version. Hiw about a non Bruno Mars or The Weekend songs for the Michael Jackson AI?
Nahhh hed be way more aggressive
ai can't replicate the same passion in his voice
Now have Bruno sing a micheal song
when are we getting j cole on painting pictures
Please let me be first HAHAHAHA
I miss some hiii hiiii after every sentence from michael
I love your videos. can you try to do post Malone doing this song
"it's not complete without his ""yiihee...!!!"""
are you sure that’s Michael Jackson? cause it sound like Bruno Mars
do more Bruno Mars' song and make it AI Michael Jackson
i really enjoyed this love MJ 🥰
A remix featuring Mj would have been amazing! 😭💕
The voice is just the same and the only difference is their accent.
I'd love to hear someone who sounds like MJ and cover other songs with MJ's signature sounds like hee hee and that sound like he's gulping.
"no MJ has a signatures AI can't replace, bruno's voice and MJs voice had a similar tone so easy for AI to duplicate it."
i want to like aperol spritz SO badly but i just cant
"Aperol Spritz is a drink that tastes better the more youve had, love it"
Hugo or Limoncello spritz is so much better 😮‍💨
Aperol spritz looks better than it tastes and I am ashamed that I try to convince myself everytime its good and still fall for it that it tastes bad
"you should try hugo spritz, it’s way better 😄"
Limoncello Spritz for me not a fan of Aperol can’t wait for that taste of summer again😂
We know the vibes well 😌
For those who don’t love Aperol but love the idea of it… try a Cappelletti Spritz… gamechanger
@alexandra this summer
Meeeeeee but I’m pregnant so I found a non alcoholic spritz to dupe for the summer 😂
literally me
I can’t wait!
@libraenthusiast your time to shine!
"Getting emotional to see this, considering aperol spritz was just introduced to the us the year I moved here 7-8 years ago🥹"
I feel like the same people that think cilantro tastes like soap also don’t like aperol… 😂
@Elizabeth Haughey I didn’t have enough over summer 🥲
I’m in the portion of the population whose palate makes Aperol Spritz taste like Lysol so I can’t relate to this
These don’t even get me lit I just be drinking them for the aesthetic 😂
bro they should hire you to work on the fnaf movie
Y’all gotta stop making these or FNAF is one day gonna happen 😂
Question so exactly how do you fall asleep with this stuff
didn't we learn our lesson with chucky cheese?😭😭
Will the bite of 87 repeat
THIS IS AWESOME
bros gonna be the next william
bro i swear if everyone makes these fnaf is gonna be real
You are extremely talented
you should make it so that the eyes glow

“Kids have gone missing suddenly and they all knew each other.”
Definitely using this before my baptism
I use this to see my man never disappoints 🤭😗
No cuz the way the primer of this is SO GOOD too!!!
"For those who are saying that it didn’t work for them, you have to set your whole face with powder first!!!!!!"
Mine did the same thing 😂 I said not a can full of air!
Instantly thought of @poorlildarkbxy
"I’ve been through 5 people, it’s so worth it"
Okay so now I’m convinced I got air in a can because I thought I was tripping😂😂
Mine must be broke. Cause it still transfers 🤷🏾‍♀️
Idk I used mine and it’s not really doing anything I still get super oily end of day
need this for carnival szn
"Need for the summer, it’s spring and I feel like I’m melting already lol"
I thought mines was broke 😂
Mine does this. I didn’t know I bought a broke one 😅
I get very oily and when I use this trust me that makeup don’t move. It just smell like hair stray lol
It’s VERY light! It makes you feel like you’re not spraying enough ! lol
I’ve been using this since I discovered last year and it’s literally amazing😭 the only makeup product I make sure to stock up on when there’s a sale
The best tripple kill
ultimate bias wrecker 😩😩❤️
It’s 9am….give me a second 😅😍
I LOVE UR EDITS CAN I GET AN HI?
CHRIS
can you han plsss
THIS IS SO GOOD!😨💗🔥
Can you make one for Leedo oneus?
I love him so much bro and this edit ate
HELP- not the search being cat noir edit-💀✋
"""Fixed"" more like I vented about what he did that hurt me, he gave me a half assed apology, then said ""There's nothing else I can do"" Like bruh 😂"
just communicate then…be honest and dont lead on a friendship you’re gonna let go of within a week again 💀
Why not just tell them its not fixed and fix it?
either communicate the problem or drop the person. it’s unenjoyable for both parties if there is remaining hate/dislike
"i hope you are able to work on your communication problems sometime! ifyou have a grudge you want to hold, don’t continue a friendship or relationship"
"the answer is always ""nah bc I would never do you the way you did me"
"nah cuz if it’s ME tryna fix the problem but it’s U tryna sweep it under the rug, im giving u that look too"
The amount of times they told me « yeah yeah it’s fine don’t worry 🫶🏻 » and then cut me off abruptly 💀💀 really smart
"If they don't talk to you about it, it's their problem, not yours"
"I opened the fly's wings, and then roared that it hurt"

when will this be released for the sega genesis?
Soon I won’t need to go to Airsoft games to make videos.
will you play it?
will this be on ps5
"and for those that are wondering what game, its called unrecorded."
Unreal Engine 5
"bro these graphics are scary, I grew up with Atari 2600 and ps1 👀👀"
looks like a @Detroit: Become Human game but on first person view.
imma say it's airsoft😏
game is called * unrecorded *
The game is called Real Life for those wondering
Is this one of them new virtual reality type video games?
It’s called Unrecord
whats the name of this game

It’s hard to eat constantly tbh I’ve tried to eat multiple times a day whether it’s a snack & a meal my body just rejects it at a certain point 😒
bro i just rewatched the other videos again love the vids🫡
"someday bro will be asking ""can i clean here"""
Abs are shown in the kitchen but abs are made/built at the gym
I love watching this journey for the both of you. Best relationship ever
what types of food you recommend?
Frfr ? I’m fat rn can’t lie ! But if I’m in the gym an I’m trying to grow muscle I have to eat ? But goood foods an working out an having a schedule ?
That’s why sometimes I don’t workout as much anymore bc i know I can’t eat that much. I don’t have enough money to eat 3 time a a day. Only 2 meals
I’m too distracted by his crocs in the gym that I have to watch it 3x
@crazy_on_60 see I’m not fat
6 times a day is too overwhelming. Just get the message across that he needs to eat more than what he is having right now to gain mass
So cute god bless you
sooooo cute and gorgeous!!!
Awwww beautiful baby
This is a picture of perfect health and life .So refreshing in absolute innocence .Oh my God Your name is wonderfull the work of your hands 😍

I’m not of fan of either one of them but Ryan Garcia needed this loss. He was getting to cocky. Hopefully this humbled him a bit.
“Tank what’s yo zelle” 😂
It was a good fight over all
They really bestfriends and they just fooled a whole bunch of ppl n made millions from it 😂
Ryan finally got what he wanted. Tanks number.😂😂
Bro tank was just there for the money he don’t want no respect or anything 😂😂
ryan was humbled. he will get better. respect to both. but Ryan learned a lesson. don't go chasing fights ur not ready for
Cashapped him
"Ryan: “I’ll wire you the purse right now, what’s your info?”"
Ryan is gon be a problem he only 24
y’all talm bout poor ryan like he ain’t still win a couple million
It was a good fight
Nice sportsman's ship..Great fight my brothers
tank typing that cashapp in 😂
"They got the bag 💼 ain’t give a dam about the fans they funna have a drink after and party, he saving his numbers and doing reservations look at em"
All the beef was just promo for the fight
Y’all shoulda known there was never bad blood it was jus to hype up the fight I knew as soon as I seen the live wit them and Kai
Dubai palm cruising is a vibe fr

How Kaeya’s character demo should have looked like:
"I still don't understand how kaeya can be a 4 star, it's too bad that such an important character has 4 stars."
how do you do this biri omgggg
Khanreia will be out and Biri still won’t do a collab with me
HOW DO YOU FILM LIKE THIS😭😭😭
dayum this is so good. just like a movie trailer
we can enter the gate 4.3 i guess
the fact that he was in sameru in dains quest.. i think he was going to this place
that's what kaeya trailer supposed to be
he's coming home
i really wish they did some easter egg or achievement when you walk to these door with Kaeya
if we don't get a five star skin for him istg
As a Kaeya main I’m ashamed to admit I thought it was Yelan.
THE CAT IS SO FUNNY
idk why but the cat reminds me of daijin from suzume
how cute
bruh how is this safe
I would never
why does it look too fast. like whiplash here i come
Brain damage 😳 that’s what this ride is called
ummm that's a hard NOPE for me
Can you imagine if just one bolt came loose?
I died just watching 😱
that's gotta be sped up no way people would come off conscious
Ride is called NOT A DAMN CHANCE
I thought it would hit the rock
"its sped up , u can see it by people in the backround"
This has to be sped up they’d be pulling way to many g’s going that fast
I saw a phone fall at the start
UMMM…. That’s a little too fast
show it without speeding up the original one
speeded up
Did anyone else think they were gonna crash into the rock
No amount of money would I be payed to get on this
"My cat doesn’t do this…he just trust me, because he knows I won’t bang his head😅😅"
Sanaa played this role so good that I didn’t start back liking her until last year 😭
How she mad at her mama for what her dad did ☠️
“where did i go wrong with you”
She let her childhood trauma destroy her adulthood
No lie this was Tyler Perry's best work EVER with the family that preys. he should've made this into his tv spin-off.
The Family That PREYS
he infact did Not marry her
She wasnt trying to convince them she was trying to convince herself bc deep down she knew 😭
she became the one thing she hated most 😂
the fact she wanted to do that to someone else and some kids like she don’t kno the pain is insane
How you get em is how you lose em 🙆🏾‍♀️
Her momma tried to warn her but she was in her own little world 😭😭😭😭
These Tyler Perry movies were eatinggggg
so why she want to be apart of that? she wants him to leave his family and leave them broke w no support?
It’s never the absent parents fault
This is how 80% of my generation looks like. Clinging onto men that don’t love them- that aren’t loyal to them. Just a bunch of side pieces… 🥺
"Funny enough, he was actually going to marry her. But he didn’t have a prenup with the first wife.😂"
Her Karma was so satisfying at the end cus she deserved it!
and....... she enjoyed the ride😂
Weren't they mother and daughter in Love and Basketball too? DAMN...Monica got slapped for talking to her mama like that. What happened!?! 😂
"Hey I really enjoyed this video, and thought it was very informative. Could you do a video on choosing between the different engineering principals?"
"I love engineering, but university is making me hate it. There’s literally no creativity in engineering education"
Don’t need to enjoy math. Just need to resist dying a little instead
Engineering is fun but it requires a LOT of patience
Computer Engineering baby
Was looking for a reason to quit but this only confirmed this is what I would be doing smh
Thanks chase stokes
"nah bro, im in 4th year, never really liked math, still at it, you gotta be persistant. You can work through everything. excuse my English."
Currently in my senior year of mechanical engineering and this is one of the best descriptions/explanations of what the schooling is that I’ve heard
Where my Chem E’s at?
I don’t think you have to enjoy math you just have to be good at it
Can you spot the typo? 😳😂
Do they have Computer information system major at GT?
You said math and now I don’t want to do engineering
"Me a senior in ME, I hate it here"
Wished I was better at maths
I really enjoyed it.

"We have the same fear, difference is that it actually happened"
Depart from me I never knew you …

YESS SUMMON THE GIRLS
Finally an angle from the front! I was worried no one was hyped. My Korean is not good but that night it would’ve of worked 😆
"the performance gave me chills I literally dropped tears I was so proud, these women did it, it wasn't even about what group you stan,"
THE ICONIC SILHOUETTE AT THE END
I'm fr getting chills watching this 😩 they're so stunning. pls
Finally front row view ong I’ve been wanting to see this view

I just started listening to BP this year & I had chills watching the livestream. can’t imagine the feeling of a long time fan watching in person.
THE GIRL SCREAMING IS SO MEEEE
The dancers were giving 🔥

We need your playlist

bro edged us with the drop
Music with no drops 🕺🏽
We needa see the setup
wheres the BASS DROP !! 😂 do it again with the bass dropping
"Subhanallah, it give me goosebump.. thats clearly not a coincidence but a sign"
Another sign.
gave me chills
not to mention they will be raised up at the age 33 on the doj
We all know what punishment theyll receive when even the environment itself wont give them a place to hide from it
is this the aya that is on page 33 ?
Im not crying you are
ye im converting
How many coincidences will it take 😳
For surely it is not the eyes that are blind but the hearts. — Quran 22:46
"Indeed it is not the eyes that are blind, but it is the hearts in the chests that grow blind. Surah Al Hajj, 22:46"
Nasheed name pls anyone
Its not the eyes that are blind but its the heart…
reciters name?
I have chills
SubhanAllah this can’t be a coincidence when will people wake up?
"Neurosurgeon here. Do not underestimate spine surgery. I am not talking about simple discectomy. The magic starts with spinal cord, cancers or AVM."
Internal medicine residents are the backbone of the American healthcare system and the amount of work and exploitation they go through is insane!
"you really had EM and IM in here over Gen Surg and CT? idk abt that bro. 😂. Hell, i think Gen Surg might be harder than Ortho"
What about cardio thoracic surgery?
You are a plethora of knowledge I really appreciate you sharing all of this. Thank you so much.
"I’d move ortho up and add gen surg. And take EM and IM off the list, especially since those residencies are only 3 years"
EM here. Def work less than most other residents. But every hour of work..is physical/mental work. I often don’t sit/eat/drink/bathroom entire shift.
Vascular surgery?
No one’s seeing 8/10/12 patients an hour in EM 😂 that’s impossible
What are the easiest residencies in your opinion?
Fair assessment. Would either add Gen Surg or replace EM.
What’s your opinion on plastic surgery residency?
Let me help you out. Replace EM with general surgery and your list is valid.
How in the world do you not include general surgery ???
Everyone has opinions…… but EM over gen surg?🤷🏼‍♀️I don’t think so
A cardiology fellowship would fit in here. I agree with the overall take from the creator.
That’s for the respect for EM!!
Thank you
Great list. How about Cardio thoracic?
Secretary Pete for President
A collab I didn’t know that I needed
"come on Pete, what about all the train derailments?"
Get Pete to talk about Ohio

nothing to see in ohio.. this video would have been helpful at Christmas time.
This is AWESOME!!
"This is great! If you’re able and have access to him, please ask about the Ohio derailments and what can be done for these residents who are terrified"
This is fantastic. Thanks so much for sharing.
Meanwhile….OHIO…..
First and I love you <3
When Pete’s too busy doing TikTok’s to go to Ohio!
"The site says Controlable delays, so something like weather wouldn't count. I was stuck in Tampa last month bc of weather in NC. 🙁"
Got delayed by 2 hours and 50 minutes the other day lol
"Hi Erica, I was on frontier and they delayed my flight for the next day will the next three days they say they could not compensate me with anything"
Thank you Erica😁
Bro like now u about to find out why my parents pay $500 a month
It had to be the tiger claw that cholo was scared of 🫳🏻🫴🫳🏻😳😂😂
he has been waiting for that moment in years.
Im doing this next time someone calls me out😂😂 they was shook Lord😅
"Show the whole video, the guy in red knocked that wanna be Killah out."
"they're like, oh hell no nevermind...😂😂😂"
This is a good tactic if you don’t know how to fight 😂 really get into your opponents head
White guy vs cholo en YouTube
This would’ve been crazy 😂
Ima be honest the only reason I saw the whole video was cus of the jam 🤣 💃🏻
I would be afraid too
I took karate classes for over a year and ironically the red shirt guys stance is almost spot on to how we were told to do it LMAOUEJSI
Intimidatily... Chamaco wins.
Red ranger vs lean like a cholo
Isn’t this on YouTube? Karate man does lay him out 😳
One time in 1987 I did the karate kid stance in Mexico and dude backed down 😂😂

they prolly just posted a tutorial on how to build the pyramids on youtube or sum
In reality there's a period of history we have no ideas about
All the land is connected. Just different elevations everywhere.
"The misconception is that we think we are smarter than them. When they were always smart, just different tech and environment."
Fallen angels built the pyramids
the book of jubilees has ocean vs land mass ratios flipped before the flood of noah
Tell me something that I don’t know
We’re spiritually connected. They didn’t have contact it’s possible for good ideas and thoughts to be universal
It's that not deep. It's just a cool looking shape that's structurally stable.
"the pyramids in Iran and Iraq look a lot similar to the Aspero pyramid in Perú, all that distance and time in between yet so similar..."
Phoenicians were exploring the oceans about 2000 BC
Basic math proves how they defo were smarter than us and communicated. Watch hidden sacred numbers by Randall Carlson x

"The game was training us for the ""moment"""
Poor Leo tho.. he got betrayed. I played this with my brother and it’s great game btw
there should have been an ending where they both live..
Leo's ending was much better imo
"@Cooper Dolby we should’ve played this game together, I played it with james but we didn’t finish it"
this is an amazing game but now i'm crying because of the betrayal in both endings
@Real Andrea i’ll know
@ammma.r we need more games like this
Why did he shoot him tho
i played it with my uncle we cried at the ending.

You saved so much money & stress! Why pay THOUSANDS to please others and have a free meal. That money belongs to y’all! 🙏🏼
Why spend thousands on people we barely talk to when we can have intimate moments just us 🤷🏻‍♀️❤️

not jsut lino but everyone else they really should’ve postponed the schedule everyone looks so sad and down
they shouldn't have forced him to do this schedule
Poor moonbin:( even if I have I never Stan Astro it’s still sad that another kpop idol has died :(
We are here for you lee know <3
I hope everybody is okay

He’s not the only one there u know these is other people
"I can’t believe they made him still do this, they should have rearranged all their schedules 😕"
im worry about them so much 🥺🥺🥺thay work too much
moon played a rlly good part in this kpop gen
"I hope everyone will feel better, Moon will be missed❤️"
I don’t know why they still had the show today everyone is so upset
Lee know and HYUNJIN 🙁🙁
@Nicole AU PROSTA ISETI GABRAZEBULI VAR RESCHEDULING RO AR GAAKETES DA MAINC GAMOSVLA RO MOUWIAT
its great mubank made a big contribution into giving moonbin lots of love and care but they could do that by making smth special for him like a tweet-
"I hope everyone will be ok, I don’t even Stan Astro but I never felt this sad before for someone I didn’t know rest in peace binna"
Leeknow was pretty close to moonbin especially after the tiger inside performance:(
jin at the beginning😩 and jimin too😳

Bro would kill it in stand-up comedy though
dat man funny asl im sorry😭😭
The way he didn’t even say that but it just seems like something he 100% would 😭😭

his tweets are so funny oml
I wish he would have stayed in reality tv/ business 😭 his marketing is amazing
Tell me why I thought this was Selena Gomez
IM CRYINGGG
Ok but did he actually say that 😭😭 i literally can never find a clip just a photo with subtitles
he just be talking but… 😭
"what manager/role is this, would love to work for a leader like this!"
THIS is a great manager
"Per a quote from Ted Lasso, “A good mentor hopes you’ll move on. A great mentor knows you will.”"
She isn’t a boss. She’s a leader.
it’s so validating seeing u be vulnerable putting in ur two weeks because no one talks about how hard it is 🥺
More leaders like this!
THAT is a leader. She will be in your court for the rest of your career.
Girl is your boss hiring because i really need a kind boss like her 🥺
Wait I love your boss🥹
Protect this woman at all cost!! what an amazing manager 👏🏽
I’ve cried at every job I’ve ever quit regardless if I loved or hated it haha. This is so sweet!!!!
This woman will be a reference for life for you! Stay in touch with her - I promise it will be so good for you to keep this person in your life!
This is so sweet
the manager we all wish we had :’)
"What a brilliant, compassionate manager. It’s managers like this that can have us actually enjoy work!"
When i quit my job I started balling my eyes out bc I felt so guilty and uncomfy for leaving
"We ALWAYS know it’s coming, and any boss will cheer you on 🥰"
Such a great employee & boss 🥰 happy for you!
LIES. my surgery went so smooth. no pain no problems 😊 everyone is different.
Is that all worth it like wow
That’s entirely too much trouble 😳
"No sneezing? Ma’am, what?"
Umm this information is making me feel better about not getting a nose job
Do people not do their own research before an elective surgery tho?
"I think it really depends on your specific surgery. I got my nose job like 4 months ago. I can sneeze, my nose doesn’t drip. I pick and blow my nose."
brb cancelling my nose job LMAOO
"Maybe depends on doctor or if you have a dev. Septum , because half this doesn’t apply to my experience."
20 plus years my nose still drips.
"I'm NOT saying she is lying, but I got my nose done and I didn't have ANY of the symptoms she just said. maybe it depends on the surgeon 🤷🏻‍♀️"
I still wanna get 😂💗 I will do whatever it takes I just wish it’s wasn’t so expensive😭
Totally forgot another one*** they tell you your nose may be numb for 2 months - I still can’t feel my nose after 2 yrs 🙃
Y’all don’t do research before getting procedures? Like pls
i need this! what can i do to get it???
THE RING
please give me 🥺

"not me having the first one, cuz I found it on my room 🙀"
annie's ring is that you

Great now I’ll be more insufferable watching LOTR with anyone
That is beyond cool. This is why these movies are perfect. The amount of effort from Peter Jackson and his crew is astonishing.
aaand thats why lotr movies are some of the best ones ever made 😇
I like how peter jackson mobilised the entire country to make his movies
That’s why it sounds so creeepy!!!
Adding “voice actor” to my resume 🫦
practical effects for the win once again
That’s so cool. The crowd must have been so excited. Or not known what was going on😂
I now have another LOTR fact that I can point out to the disinterested girl I forced to watch with me
I had a lot of fun with this fact thank you
BUT MY LORD THERE IS NO SUCH FORCE
"I always hear ""Burn to, Ashes!"" 😂"
I feel so lucky to have lived when these released
"""Durbgu Nazg-shu, Durbgu Dash-shu"" means ""Lord of the Ring, Lord of the Earth"" in Black Speech"
Fun fact: they actually hired real Orcs for this
that's so dope
Ohh a new LOTR fact to tell while watching the movie
Adding more reasons why I love these movies.
"they did similar for TRON: Legacy. Had a convention hall full of people chanting for ""Rinzler"" and ""De-Rez"" for the Games."
This is gonna be awesome info for the next time I force my family to watch the movies with me again 🤣
I’m so close to joining this bracket. Just need another $30 Million.
I’m closer to a net worth of 30 million than Elon musk is 💪
$30M is a big number but tbh it seems astonishingly low to be considered ultra high net worth
I just need my parlay to hit
For me the point of having that much wealth is to avoid other people
I wonder what they taste like?
Houston rodeo in late February early March. After the Daytona 500. Then the monster truck rally then trout fishing in Wyoming early spring
"It’s wild to think that 90% of that 297k cannot afford most of the yachts at the yacht show. Even in this group, an even smaller group rules."
You missed the Catalina wine mixer.
i live in augusta ga lol. during masters there is so much traffic. private jets constantly landing at the airport
or you could just give money to the friends you had before and now you're all rich friends together lol
$30M is not even close the high net worth. Starts at $1B today.
All while we argue about bud light. Keep sleeping.
"Ah yes, the beautifully horizontally compressed video"
"im almost there I just need
29,999,999.98$ more!😁"
Y'all keep using paper straws why thousands of billionaires fly their privatejets to all these places💀
There’s people out there with money that one no knows about
just waiting for a ka payment
Sounds like a season of gossip girl
John Kerry also has to travel via private jet...rules for thee but not for me
that professor should be sued and have to give all that money back
I will never go to San Francisco and will continue to avoid California at all costs.
That should be against the college's policies and procedures. What lf that was a class you had to have to graduate? No way in hell.
This is my favorite news station.
"Professors also make you purchase their books for their curriculum, it’s bs"
"So, that professor was either banking or getting a tax write off. That seems legit."
"But that teacher who has $60,000 that goes to her account and she can give to Planned Parenthood and write off of it as a tax free thing."
the the teacher how does that really differ from writing their own textbooks?
"Yeah as a former business student, if I had class with that lady, syllabus day would be my first and last day there 😂"
"sounds like our ""United States"" ain't so united."
Honestly with the last story I’d prefer their funding come this way vs taxpayers. It should be completely privately funded.
City of SF once told company I worked for that we had to change our policies so they could contract for svce that only we had
Thanks for these great stories.
well I mean business is business

Miyah…phone on my dresser now‼️😭
you would know if it’s a baby bc it would stretch your cervix and you would have literal contractions and be screaming even if it’s small
BRO HOW CAN YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE?! IM LITERALLY GOING THROUGH THIS RN
My mom had this with me ..
@lilyzettyy just incase the rafe edits be hitting a little to hard
@idkatthispoint1111 THESE COMMENTS GOT ME DEAD
the worst kind of people are people that make people feel bad about something they’re excited abt -ts
"Are ppl ok? Getting a guitar pick of an artist you love is always a huge deal!!!! I love your passion & enthusiasm, I would react the same tbh lol"
there are men who jump over children to catch baseball's .... 😂 ... I would literally die if I caught the guitar pick of Taylor swift 😭
people are so mean FOR WHAT
Acting like they didn’t get mad at the Tubi commercial during the Super Bowl…😂
I’m so sorry I posted a similar video of me crying at her concert and would have been so sad if people were this mean
they’re literally so unkind. i’m sorry you got these.
men jump over each other to catch baseballs at a game. I've seen middle aged men physically fight over a 90s rocker throwing a shirt into the crowd
Mmmm. Your tears are 6 million percent valid.
"Taylor said she’s a big advocate for not hiding your enthusiasm for things. She’d be so proud, as all swiftie are! Frame that pick!"
"Notice how the majority of comments are from men, if they don't care about your passion why just not swipe down"
There’s no reason to actively shit on someone’s video when it doesn’t concern you. I’m so sorry this happened to you!
"people are so bold behind their profile pictures these days, there’s no accountability for their unkind words!"
"being a fan and loving something so deeply is such a beautiful thing, why do we try to make people ashamed of it. it's such a potent, special feeling"
"I AM SO SO HAPPY FOR YOU <333 women are constantly berated for enjoying things, but this is what makes you happy!! so never stop <3"
Like Taylor said haters gonna hate.. I’d act the same way if that happened to me

The narcissist mother.
Did you all notice that the mother is dressed like a black swan w/ the same kind of necklace/ earrings/ hair Nina wears? Her in black Nina in white!😱
she protects her too much and prevents her from becoming a woman but the cake scene I don't understand why it's not bad ???
I think the all bad character was her mom
whats wrong with her mom i dont get it everyone talks about how bad she is
natalie has the sweetest voice
This was literally me and my mother
Not Cora saying SwanQueen what in the multiverse..
The subtle detail of the way the mom does a little choreographed “ta-da” gesture like a dancer might because she WAS a dancer before Nina…
Bella Hadid mother
CORA?????IS SHE ALWAYS A BAD MOM???
i can never let this be me (not that i have any chances of this being me)
She reminds me a little bit of Jessica Lange
this movie is insanely good

"been saying this for a long time! I don't blame my parents for not teaching me, but I will be top blame for not learning and teaching my kids"
I’ve been saying this..
Worst part wen yo try taking the risk on investing it’s your own family the one not supporting an d trusting
It’s up them to learn

Thank you

Thanks for putting it in perspective!!
Blue tooth tail
WHAT THE DUCK
"Math wasn’t mathing, brain wasn’t braining 😂😂😂"
"cool to see it actually works, the cat focus on the tail instead"
Don’t worry Guys the tail will grow back
I was 12 when this happened it was a nightmare🥺I was horrified and couldn't sleep all night that day🥺
@mirirene84 the TRAMA
they do that naturally. it breaks of from the same muscle spasm that makes it look like a wiggly worm left behind. they'll grow another tail.
"Yeah that happens, I once stepped on one of those lizard and it’s tail came off and was still moving under my foot"
The cat : Hey bro you Lost your tail….
than cruel 🥺
All my cat does this to lizards 🦎
fun fact: lizards do loose their tail and grow new ones.
Lizards do this as a defence and the tail grows back 👍🏻
The cat: did it give birth?
my baby fever 📈
SHE SO CUTE
I WANT ONE.
A lot of people blur there young babies faces to make them safe but I do recommend doing that for her too keep her safe
why do you keep them wrapped?
This was so adorable. Thank you for sharing.!
She’s adorable💕💕 awww
Omg same outfit as my baby cousin
Gimme please.
SHE IS A THE DEFINITION OF CUTIE PATOOTIE
@c_lphotos baby fever 😔
@Aleks see there are cute babies
i need this but for adults
@Firecans okay maybe i don’t hate kids
i don’t know why ppl r ordering prom dresses in amazon
first mistake was goin to amazon for a prom dress n the only thing u can do now is get it tailored
i literally just saw another girl order a amazon prom dress… why?
we’re we supposed to be like “omg they’re so wrong for that” ?? ISSA PROM DRESS FRM AMAZON 😭😭😭😭
ording it was amazon was the first red flag
just need it altered and ur all good
you literally got what you ordered 😂 just get it altered babe !!!
If you can…. Since the waist and add gold details from Amazon or hobby lobby
Girl I would literally cry and die and roll and flip and beat eb on Amazon and report the whole website and have it all cancelled bc omg
it’s giving “crying in my prom dress” fr
it’s actually not that terrible. If you get it altered it would look so good!!!
Amazon seriously😭😭😭
get ts altered n youll b gzs
I feel like those who paid have the right to be upset ngl
ok but people r allowed to be upset
no reason for him to promote and headline a massive show if he wasn’t ready. He needs more time to himself
i started crying when he started talking ab ryan
dis man needs a longer break he tired of all of us🤦‍♀️
people who are saying it’s been 3 years are insaaaaane grieve has no time frame
It’s more the fact that he wasn’t ready and tried anyway and disappointed all his fans bruh it’s ok to grieve
he’s definitely about to take a even longer break after this.. I feel so bad for him
broo plus it wasn’t even his fault. coachella is mad strict with curfew. coachella is at fault if anything bruh
No fr and the fact that him and his brother used to go to Coachella. Makes it even harder
honestly if anyone spent more than $500 on a coachella ticket solely because of frank than that's on them because this wasn't a frank concert
Honestly at least he had the courage to show up I love him with all my heart💯💯
i feel like he thought he was able to do this . maybe last min it was just to much for him . grief isnt easy especially when the set was dedicated 1/2
thank you
i feel so bad for him. grieving is hard enough then for him to finally build up the courage to perform again FOR him. and now he’s gonna see everyone-
still doesn’t excuse the changes he made on purpose to get out of the show early. you prepare for months in advance and he literally said F everyone.
even if the set may have been disappointing or not good enough i’m just glad he was brave enough to even preform after 3-6 long years
exactly im glad i got to watch him on lives
"CAPTION!!!! yesss couldn’t agree more, if you can sit there and complain about it then you’ve never really experienced grief frfrs"

I dont get the difference between stem and split

this is my sign to continue as batman
I remember I learned how to stitch like a little bit from YouTube because all my sock had holes in them 😭

Why is your RuPaul voice so accurate 😂😂😂
Wait but you kinda ate that Rupaul impression
ru paul was sick for this lmaoo
Bro fr hit the exact notes on that first “a draAag queen???” 😂
Why did you do the Ru impression so good? 😭
the way them guts was bubbling 😭🤣
Rupaul really didn’t need to do him like that 💀💀💀
I'm convinced this was a power move by Ru 😭
his soul took a screenshot 😭
Bruh was questioning his existence his life choices mentally preparing himself to lose his career and ascending at the same time ✋💀
doing mental math to figure out if he could live without his show
the wheezing at the end 💀
He looked TERRIFIED 😭😭
You can see his face drop and his eyes twitch to the camera💀💀
Just then the king felt true fear for the first time
I swear he was about to start sobbing 😭
We miss you with now united🥺🥺🥺
"what did yall want her to do, a full tumbling combo?!?"
Not every song has to have back breaking choreo ppl. This fits her and the vibe of her song
I feel like people always want some hard hitting energetic dance but honestly for this type of song I can’t imagine that💀
ppl getting mad that the dance is easy yet most kpop groups are doing easy choruses so WE can do it 😭
Yall always got smth to say like anyone asked for it..💀
Y’all giving him back handed compliments not knowing he’s the one who choreographed some of the most popular kpop songs
We miss you with Blackpink so I was really happy when I learned it was you who did Jisoo's solo😭🥰

In other words ya might lose focus but remember your purpose

No matter what aspects of life throw or temptations u will be loyalty and honest for the one u value and love not to hurt them.
I think it is about aura Skin

lol worried about the kid with the dog in tho oven not going to kie
Some of these are cute but damn some parents need to teach their kids before it ends badly 😳
Now we know how some really bad things happen. 😳 Some clips are cute and some just scary and irresponsible. Both need protection.
some of those dogs were not ok with what was happening. poor pups
the baby giggles are adorable.. the stressed out Dogs not so much
Husky’s are toddlers too
The kid with the water hose laugh sounds like it was on repeat
The baby who said ✨DIG✨was so cute 🥰
And this is why we have so many family owned dog bite cases!! We need to teach our kids boundaries when it comes to the family pet.
I don't need a baby.. I don't need a baby... I don't need a baby..
I feel the need 2 say something.... That's all great in fun but some of these antics can go south real quick...Dogs can only put up w/ so much.
The one that snuck the cookie said that’s the tax for walking by lol😂
"And then the dog is fed up with it, and then the dog suddenly is the problem..."
I love some of these videos but some could of ended really badly.
Pooh the babies laughter is so cute and contagious cause I can't help but to laugh just listening to them!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️
kids and dogs. so much fun. unconditional love.💜💜
This is the absolute best video on TikTok🥰
the girl is clearly the fav child
if you can afford to do that you can afford to get two rooms
At least we know who the fav is
The lack of light in the boy’s room💀💀💀
Can we just talk about how they kids DEMOLISHED the room in the beginning 💀💀💀
im concerned about the hassle of getting those towels
The boy is going to become a future discord mod with a room like that☠️
Sooo the girl can look down at the boy changing?
"the look :🥰🥰🥰
the price : ☠☠☠"
"If your design is being used illegally, what should you do?"
where is the tiger
"""prolly not"""
I liked the room before tbh🙄
The way they literally went through the walls 😃
i can already hear the kids arguing over who gets the the upper bed
Not the same 😂😂😂
2 kids will be fighting for who is going to get the top so can u make one with 2 top beds so they don’t fight… I’m just bored
oh I love that 😄😄😄
they let ur room look like that in the military
Shi i was 30 minutes late the other day 💀
Just remember being late 5 minutes or 2 hours have the same consequences. Get that extra 2 hours of sleep 😴
see thats the motivation that'll get me outta bed
"The marines really tried to convince me to join saying, “they will pay for your college and you get money” like💀what about my life….."
Y’all can’t call out? 😳
I remember when they made my shop come in after we all tested positive for Covid. They said we all had it anyways so we couldn’t spread it lmaooo
that's when u call medical
Ngl I’ll take a day of jail to skip training 😂
Wait until that’s the reason. Once you get out and don’t go to work there goes the roof over your head
what if yall get sick? then what?
ah another reason not to join 😂😂😂
Sometimes ion wanna wake up at 4 am for pt 💀
what happens if y’all accidentally wake up late ? 😀

I be having full blown conversations with myself and making up scenarios 😂😂😂
"Oh I don’t have to worry about that. I scream at the tv, books, flies, TikTok and just about everything else every other minute. I think I’m safe"

They glass is still stained
Why is this getting excited
Soap doesn't exist i write it on my note
What about the outside of the glass where people’s mouths and fingers have been?
Too fancy for my lifestyle 🥺
Do Garden City. That'll humble anyone.
Southampton would humble any other town ong
I mean it's a rich section of LI but no where near the richest areas.
drive through old Brookville and old Westbury you'll see mansions.
"Come to north shore. Brookville, oyster bay cove, locust valley all beautiful homes on acres"
drive through Wyandanch
All on the water no doubt
Yo that’s my friends house 😳
Try Potomac Maryland
Come to Lloyd harbor
this doesn’t humble me😭 would be rude to any of these homeowners at my customer service job
i live in a 2 bedroom condo in long island when ever i walk outside my little town i’m humbled
Do Hempstead
Yo i pass my house
Go to Lawrence
Avrage florida house
That’s probably Massapequa by the waters 😅

"0 privacy, 0 kids left at home once they turn 18 🔥"

Ima wait till these kids turn 18 and leave so they can spill the real tea
Can a dirt bike fit in the camper
"I’d totally own a camper/RV but not with kids full time, kids need space"
If you had one child with you in an camper then ok but not with 3 kids
Friends come over? U can go to ur friends just chill in their front yard 😅😂
Live in it full time ?!? Y’all are losing so much money
All that money for a camper you’d think they make those back doors cable assisted. 😅
If my parents make me live in an RV full time I’m definitely moving as soon as I could afford it and resent them for the rest of my life.
I would run away
Thanks for that extra space they really need it
"that doesn't look safe to me, I'd add some pillars for support maybe"
one thing I've always wondered is why the camper back deck when there's all that ground right there.
Do you need supports under the deck to take the weight?
thats my sister
i would like that dude to be my dad im ngl😭
This song bumps in my truck everyday like a ritual in the school lot

@_.sofia444 teach ur parrot
Speedy little fella

Go for experience not the food
"I wouldn’t say the fanciest, but it’s unique. Been going there for years, and the food is decent, but you mainly go for the atmosphere."
"Not a fan. Over rated expensive food, but the tiny cable car is fun when it’s working."
Where exactly is this
I’ve been - food wasn’t amazing lol - the experience was tho.
I’ve never eaten there but I’ve been there. It’s beautiful.
"Yes, this is more of an experience than the food place but nevertheless, super cool it would be a wonderful date night. How is this place holding up?"
Website states they have a dress code 🙄
"Didn’t know it had new owners. It did feel a little more casual than it it years ago, but I attributed it to pandemic."
Views are incredible!
@jay.emm21 I’ve been to Capitola but I did not know about this place. Now I must go back.
They also have a really old really adorable taxi that will pick you up and take you to the restaurant
We had our tiny wedding reception here. One of my favorite spots. ❤️❤️❤️
@thesesunseteyes I would like to take you here sometime. It seems like an interesting date night in the future.
"They have a great, inexpensive happy hour. I go all the the time."
"definitely not the fanciest, but certainly special."
Love that place . I haven't been in years but it's worth it
"first , must have money"
who has rooms that are this tall tho. amazing ideas but need rooms double height
man was scared of closets 😟
I want all those shelves for my kpop albums 😍
does anyone have a library in their room😂😂whats with all the books😂😂😂
That’s a whole house
Popular bedroom design❌whole house in one room ✅
"falling of the side be like:
MOMMY HELP ME--"
App name please
Too much books😂
It is like a house more then a bed room 😂😅🥰🥰
Why do all of these have a bed on the upper section?
Remaining a bathroom 😂
So this room is 3.2x3.0 meters and you're trying to tell me you can fit an entire appartment in this?!? #insane
"Why don’t the donate them, sad"
I want that pink hoodie SO bad I haven’t been able to find it anywhere😭 now ik it’s in a dumpster
this def staged lol
Ima need that Nike tech
lol those dumpsters are supposed to be locked. This was an employees stash 👀
These companies rather throw it away than give it to those in need 🙄
"I know, this stuff should be donated. But why can’t the employees just take it home. That’s messed up"
@itsnotmyspammmm @alexi.shuler can we go dumpster diving
Y’all def staging this
I don’t think Nike is just throwing it away. I think an employee is putting clothes in garbage bags and throwing them away to come back later.
"This going to the landfills everyday, should be illegal to pollute like this plus this could be given to orphans or homeless"
I so wish I didn’t live in the middle of nowhere and I could do this!
This is so said.
and they didn't cut it. that is a nice score.
ummm where is this🌚
Where’s this
My jealousy just went through roof…. 😂

don't have to go to Venice if you've been to San antonio
What's funny is they probably view it the same way San Antonio residents view their riverwalk 😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂You can take the girl out of San Antonio but can’t take the San Antonio out the gurl
Not me thinking you guys were in Vegas at the Venetian
That’s by River center mall right?
"As a San Antonian I was like, where in the river walk is that?!!! 🤣🤣"
I live in San Antonio and there is no freaking way that any of the Riverwalk here looks like that !!
Waittt I thought it was Xochimilco!!
"As a San Antonian, thank you 😂❤️"
As someone who lives in San Antonio this had me dead😂
they made the Venetian resort a real place!
DANG IT!! I’m going in the summer and I wanted to make an audio like this 🤣🤣
loooool I just did the boat ride on San Antonio 😂 I was so impressed
I appreciate the SA Riverwalk even more now😁
"I didnt understand the hype, I didn't think it was pretty at all."

that’s too much work
Everyone’s just ignoring that car that popped in outta nowhere 😭
Okay but why that maroon car driving on the wrong side of the road 😂😂😂
manual is leg🦵 workout 😁
"people saying that's too much work when in reality, you dont really think much about it, 😁"
Why did I watch the whole thing as if I don’t drive a manual every day?
seems like a lot of work. imma stick to automatic 😂
The worst thing it’s when you’re learning to drive and you’re going uphill
"using manual teaches you to ""listen"" to the engine and know how to really handle your car. At least for petrol motors"
"Switching from manual to auto was the best decision I made, I used to hate drinking because of the clutch."
"Driving manual for 30 years I’m so over it, I want to relax in an auto now"
"learnt to drive in a manual, first three cars were manuals"
u remove Ur leg that many times in traffic?😳😂
It's an anti theft device that can't be driven by the younger generation
Automatic makes your life easy.
what behaviour is risky from this video? I guess maybe for automatic drivers
too much work...
those without cars let's gather here we cry alittle bit 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

I’m so confused how they could go and get the case and screen protector for it before even opening it to make sure it works good first
Why ain’t nobody asking the price ?
putting on a screen protector is so stressful that i hold my breath but ain’t no way i’m trusting someone else to do it 😂
"she put that screen protector on so effortlessly,when I do it it's like looking into a bubble tea😳"
putting that screen case on costed more than the phone
She’s trying so hard to make conversation but they just refuse 😂😂
Why does she keep asking about the color 😂
She makes putting screen protector on look so easy 😐
Imagine paying 3-4x more just to install a screen protector 😂
yes they like the color😂💀
I think they like the colour
I would have never thought watching someone install a screen protector would be so satisfying.
Is she gonna change the color if he don’t like it??
U asked him you like your phone color 2 times he didn’t get the clue u where trnna talk to him
colored phones to just cover it up with a case
Do they like the colour or not 🤷‍♂️
Not me getting 10 bubbles and she makes it look so easy
The phone small talk
He instantly turned to Jackie Chan 😂😂
he instantly tuned in to spider man in jumping 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
fright will kill somebody for sure no pain no game😂😂😂
life is the first priority 😅
They knew that he was just pretending 😂😂
"He didnt feel the pain, the pain feel him 😂"
he recover quickly 😂😂😂😂
bro instantly became faster than all of them💀😂😅
bro didn't care about the pain 😂
he did what he had to do
fear for death healed the guy
I would've been more impressed if he was able to take the crutches with him 😂
just forgets his pain 😂😂😂
The pain will come after jumping 😂😂
He really said parkour!
Aeeiii he be come faster than the rest
adrenaline made him forget about the injury 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i don't know 😂😂either 😂😂
she ate and left no crumbs
“Ion even know man” LMAOAOAOA

A movie where a little girl learns life from and protected by a spirit walker
I would totally watch a movie about a little girl (her) and her Spirit Walker going on an adventure 😍💜💜💜
That is a child that is unfamiliar with evil and filled with love.
She is soooo cute with her spiritwalker puppy 🥰🥰
She’s giving Aurora vibes
She's is the queen of monsters
the happy hand stims
she is the chosen one who will lead the creatures of the night!
A kid who loves monsters will be a very interesting adult.
she has a safe environment growing up🥰
She has awesome parents! She sees nothing 'bad' 🥰
my daughter would go buy a collar and leash trying to take you home 😂😂😂😂
You see there are still people in this world that don’t only do things for them selfs be one of those people who aren’t selfish
Why did her little face and hand movements make my eyes teary 🥲
She reminded me of the girl in mosters inc. The girl wasn’t afraid of the monsters and she became friends with them
the adorable little girl and the terrifying creature with its unnatural movements
you passed the vibe check. kids pick up on that

What is that pool
Running from contact
the whole point of the offense is to not try to not get hit and defense is to hit
Comments def don’t know what football drills are
"To all the comments talkin about scared of contact, this is not a hitting drill at all the whole point is to make the defender miss you..😂😂"
In a real football game the offense job is to not get tackled?? So why would they try to get tackled in this drill??
Why u would u run into the defender?
all scared of contact
3 is the leading tackler on the team ain’t he?!?!
They supposed to avoid tackling defense supposed tackle offenses
offense supposed to avoid the defense so defense can practice open field tackling
Man they not closing space
Offense ain’t want no promblems I would’ve tricked like 3 of em
People saying running from contact like my bad not everyone in a game gonna run you over some people aent huge their just elusive
wrap up
that's why u wrap up number 40
shying away from contact weakens this sport i swear
bro😂 they gotta secure the outside then force him inside towards the sidline/out of bounds
Lol I’m never going with number 11 dawg
The whole point of the drill is not to get not get hit🤦🏽‍♂️
Where can I buy

"You’ll need paper towel holder, 1 napkin holder, wait no, 2 of them, wait no 3? Ahhh it’s 4 of them 🙄"
Why did we make the video longer than necessary by counting to 4
Looks like it can hold 28 if you use the small hole in the center
This is so smart!!
Where was this life hack when I was painting traffic cones 😂 this would have been so much easier
I saw a couple of these at my Salvation Army and it was such a strange feeling to see a tiktok craft in real life.

Link on the sub box and subs ? And did you have to lift your rear seats to fit the box?

“ValentiMe” is one of my pet peeves. Thank you for teaching them!
Ugh. I just love teachers so much 🥹🥹

The search bar says “Miley Cyrus screaming” 💀
Walter: “Because tonight will be the night that I will…”
Other dogs giving him the side eye😂
everybody looks so done LMAOOOOO
why do bulldogs never sound like actual dogs 🤦‍♀️
I am convinced it’s between French Bulldogs and Huskies to be the first dog breeds to develop the ability to speak in human languages.
I thought that was Mario Judah
NOBODY PUTS cry BABY IN THE CORNER 😂😂😂
he prolly always trippin cause you named him Walter
"the way the other two just looked back at him like ""da frick"" 😂"
Walter sounds like Bon Jovi singing Living on a prayer! “
Walter was moved from first class and this is NOT acceptable to the king. 😂
That’s not Walter that’s Bon Jovi
The other dogs embarrassed fr 😂 bro on the right can’t even look at him
scared for their lifes💀
Shaq runs in slow mo😭
Bro parted that bench like Moses☠️
Shaq the Semi Truck

I ain't seen a bench get empty that quick since coach said we running sprints all practice
bro the Ball wouldnt hurt Luke the weicht of a nba player
bro spills that a whole tray of gatorade 💀💀💀
They got to change something about this maybe put barricades like in wwe

I still don’t get why they have seats legit this close when stuff like this happens jsut allows more injuries
why are they sitting too close
Omg imagine Shaq coming down on you 😳

Shaq literally split the Ocean…..
So glad the bag & car were hashtagged 😂 #getoveryourself
It’s the whistle for me 😂😂😂 “weehoo” -bottle takes off-😂
"I dropped a 2 liter in the store & it spun around & sprayed everything, the worker said “this is why we use carts” 😂😂😂"
I believe it’s #givEnchy.
“Ok😱” sounds so defeated 💀
911 what’s your emergency “ send help the fekken Starbucks is attacking “
The way it flew😭😭
The bottles like no need whatch this… she’s like okay.!
Omg I hated this! Had to get a catch guard for my vehicle
It's almost like your GIVENCHY bag was a main character 😑
Bottle said this is a guided missile system! Comin in fizzy!😂😂
Love how it sets off the whistle… uhh ok

She just accepted it 😂
The whistle did for me 😂 rich rich
Money and fancy name brands can't solve for everything 😂
I'm so confused. 😂
REUSABLE TOILET PAPER💀💀
REUSABLE TOILET PAPER WHAT

"i dont care how bad this climate gets, youll never catch me using reusable toilet paper"
So much grey
Put up some paintings dWg
I would never leave home
that honestly could’ve been a full bathroom.
"I want to see the upper part of the house, too!"
What was the sq ft of the basement
All I need is my own entrance 😂
the game nights/family parties that could happen here 🥹
Oh to be able to have a basement while living in California 😅
The gym & bar sold me. I literally would never leave home
"I love basements, wish Cali homes had basements 🥹💕"
Fire home 😍😍
that’s my apartment
Definitely have to start viewing more house then.
Throw in some Scarlet and you have yourself a deal
This is any new build in iowa
Stadiums and arenas should ban signs
please chicago please don’t do this 😭 🙏 i’m short af and will be fighting for my life on the floor as it is!
Agree! I had a Harry Styles concert ruined by a sign 😢
The way that sign enraged me. What is the purpose? Truly.
At 1989 a girl in front of me put up a GIANT sign as taylor was coming out. I smacked it down. It was like a reflex 😂 she did not put it back up 😂
"People need to learn concert etiquette. between the inconsiderate screaming for attention and signs, I’m so disappointed"
"NO SIGNS, people!!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼 but can we PLEASE talk about the transition from ENRAGED to “weeeEEE” 😂🙌🏼"
Frrr Like she’s not even going to see it Imma need them to be fr
I had to (very politely) ask the gal in front of me on our floor seats opening night to pleaseeee take her hat that extended 6” off of her head off 🫣
taylor doesn’t even read the signs like 😭
Am I the only one crying for the girl in the aisle seat in the Polk a dot dress...poor girl can't see a thing someone get that girl a step stool 😭
The sign probably says Play Bad Bunny
i’m bringing mine for pics bc it goes w my outfit then it’s going in the trash
i wouldve thrown something at them 😭
acting like she’s gonna stop the show to read a sign 😭
if you have a sign atleast don’t hold it up during the songs 😭😭
They need to ban signs @taylorswift @taylornation
she literally never reads signs like wrong concert

Rooney 🔥 when I was kid he is my legend

Greatest assist of all time
Rooney is one if the greatest player of his generation Wazza is a legend

Anyone see the dude trip the over dude up at the start
what a great player he was
I’m not crying 😭😭
Rooney my best man🥰🥰
"They didn’t celebrate with Rooney,that hurts🥺🥺🥺"
No player until now can play like him for England n Manchester United.. Wazza🔥🔥🔥
Most dramatic assistance ever🙌
Rooney🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

My young people our here representing the fashion world.
the transition was hard 💯
Stanley was preparing it for all of us
Stanley living in 2020
"They don't care, come to the office. Not about being productive it's about control."
Stanley knew before we did how vital working from home is now! I could never go back to the office!
It’s 😬 extremely 😬stressful 😬
Damn Stanley was tired of the micro aggressions and racism 😔 I feel him
Stanley walked so we could run
Imagine being in this environment. It’s cute for tv but I think I’d implode
Stanley wanted to work remotely when we didnt think we could live this this
"for real- 4 months in back into the office since working fully remote the past 3 yrs, and I can feel that it's affecting my heart 😭"
gurllllllll I remember begging like this praise God I'm working from home now
The micro aggressions are traumatically cumulative
half the jobs can be done at home
What episode is this from?
a literal prophet.
Stanley knew it all
This is what I told my supervisor three months before Covid. He said “no” bc he didn’t believe people worked from home so I quit. 😂
Omg breaks my heart
me: herm mama🥺 mom: herm 🥰
pretty good

"This breaks my heart, show’s how cruel the world is."
"It’s called an anaphylactic shock reaction. I’ve had it happen to me twice. It’s rlly scary, ur throat closes up, face & ears swell. My old (1)"
The calmness of “yeah” is so sad 😔
“Just a prank” The prank:

I live in Knoxville and watched this place get built. I wanted to do my wedding here but then I saw the cost 😳 had to settle for somewhere else.
I literally live in Knoxville and am just NOW hearing about this?!
"ugh, can TN stop being so pretty. I can't give them any money but I wanna see it :("
"Would have loved to come, but will not be due to recently passed laws."
I absolutely love this place. The staff is so friendly and the grounds are magical ✨ It’s a safe little escape from the real world.
Oh my goodness this exists? So close to nashville??!!!
And I’m moving immediately.
A dream is to get married here but the packages are pricey…for a good reason of course 🥹
wait i was thinking aw how cute and then noticed it’s literally in my city
I didn’t even realize this was a place and I live in Knoxville!!
i live here but i never knew this place existed
After Christopher’s place closed…this may be our new favorite place 🥹🥰
Can’t wait to check in Saturday 😍😍
I use to work on this guys irrigation and he was ALWAYS telling me about this project. Real excitement about it. It’s turned out pretty awesome
"photographed a wedding here, everyone was so nice!! such a beautiful place"
Hahaha good look getting close to this 😂 the massively over populated Knoxville area is insane. You’ll have to park Atleast 10 miles away 😁
I love this place 🤍 coming back soon!
Stayed there for my partner’s birthday in January!! Absolutely gorgeous and everyone was so so nice!!

"Everyone: my kid isn’t allowed to eat in the car…………. ok, then this wasn’t for you 😂"
Everyone buying it for their kid- me buying it for myself 😂
The comment section does not pass the vibe check! I need this! My kid & me eat in my car & my car is spotless thank you very much!
So everyone saying that there kid doesn’t eat in the car means the kid is calm in the ride. How ??? Tell us
My kid gon wait to eat till we get home 😂 can’t stand a food mess lol
BRB *opening Amazon * ! This would be great for my kid .
You might have already posted this but where do I get the ring that is around the cup? My kiddos cup gets stuck and they have a hard time pulling it
This is nice. *opens amazon* lol. Kids make a mess everywhere but I dnt mind cleaning up after em. #momlife
The holder or the CFA?? 🥰
This is great for traveling. Also why do people need to comment if they don’t allow eating in their car? Cool story 😂
"super cool but our seats have odd cup holders. the nuna rava, Chicco Nextfit zip, Britax Marathon CT, and Britax Alligance."
Where did u purchase this?
No no we don’t. My kids do not eat in my car. That’s how you get dirty cars. We eat at the table. But neat idea for those who allow this
I would buy this but my toddler chokes on everything including her own saliva 🤦🏻‍♀️
Buying one now!
"my kids have an hour break between school so we're in a parking lot 5 days a week & use these, also have a mini vacuum. people love to complain"
My kid threw his
That’s really cool! Perfect for road trips!
"I was so unaware by so many people who kids don’t eat in the car.., okay then keep scrolling! I need this TODAY"
Bros grades were already saved 💀
Bro aint nuthin saving me 💀
They never give us the test what you talking about 💀
what if I randomly chose the answers and I got it correct ☠️☠️☠️
I would do this if my teachers didn’t make us return the tests right after we get them back
"i got a 43 on my last algebra test, i refuse to do this"
wish I got the answers then
I really would want to try these tips but in my Country there are no finals

"hi can you pleasedo 4th grade,bc l want zo sace mz grade"
"I already finished the high school, where have you been 🥺"

"I took a math test a few days ago, and my teacher marked it wrong, and if I hadn’t noticed, I would have lost a whole 7%"
Thanks for advice
I thought it was glitch and trick
My teacher doesn’t give us our tests back
U could already tell how this finna go
"but he thought of giving her lego flowers cause she is allergic to real ones, and siento time with her kids and her while arming it, that its sweet ❤️"

"not they like each other gifts , they might as well switch 😂"
the needa switch frfr
I would’ve loved the Legos
They finna do the switcharoo
I love how it’s filmed like the office the stares in the camera is so funny
This reminds me of the scene in Gilmore girls when Rory receive a birkin but didn’t know it’s value
The fact he wanted to give her flowers but she is he bought her toy flowers and she can put it together with him ❤️yeah that’s thinking of a gift
Interesting 😂

They want each other but can’t sayyyy

"My cousin just told me that when he was picking up his gender reveal cake for his baby, the baker said “congratulations, it’s a girl”😂"
Did they put the gender reveal on the outside? 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
"plot twist , the frosting was the gender reveal 😭"
"Meanwhile, another familiar is cutting into a blue or pink cake and wondering why when they ordered vanilla…😂"
The cake shop are saying you will know when the time is right 😂
Whenever I make a gender reveal cake or cupcakes I’m terrified I will accidentally forget to add the color inside! I write in ALL CAPS on the order 😬
Is the cake itself blue. 😂
The cake is literally blue 😭
Very 2023 of this bakery 🤣
Part 2 is up!
The way this would send me into a rage 😂
It’s blue on the outside though lol
😳wait is anyone else noticing that the outside frosting is hinted blue?
would it be the light blue on the cake and maybe they didn’t understand
lol I thought they put the color on the outside so it wasn't a surprise
This happened to us with our ur last baby 😅 but she did pink and blue in the inside and I wanted our last one to be a boy and saw blue frosting… 1-
The outside looks blue 🤷🏻‍♀️🤣
It’s a funny story at least 😂

@grey59grave the 3 girls
I guess everyone is different. I have been vaping for 10 years. I feel better than ever and never heard a cough coming out of me and saw difference.
probably a few more factors to it aye
Because of these story's I stopped using vapes when I use plant medicine. I am so sorry this is your reality. Prayers you get relief
"Look at the rest of her page and you’ll understand why she’s always winded, it’s not the vape.."
the danger is when you buy cheap liquid that has chemicals in it that are not safe there should be only 4 ingredients

Hell yeah
It’s a 3 way switch not 2 way and having 2 master switches is pointless in this setup bc you can’t turn one off from the other
Why 2 master switch for same function?
"Master needs to be a 3 way switch, but otherwise a good representation"
You need resistors to balance the current so one isn’t bright when only one is on
"you built the master switches wrong. you need them like: line -- -- light, so either switch turn the light off when on and on when off"
"so I have a light on on my basement, it could be any one of 3 switches, possibly all three and I have to walk around to all 3 to turn the light off"
2-way switch. Do you mean 3-Way switch
"Both Master Switches are OC, how are the rooms getting power when the current is Open at the master switch?"
I can't see the use for this at a house
Do both Master switches on next
Try 3 way switches

MINT ROSEMARY CLOVE AND GINGER 📍

3 month rule!!
"i had a rule for myself, that i wouldnt date anyone if we didnt talk for atleast 2-3 months😁 i lose feelins fast and i wanna make sure theyre the 1"
I did 11 months.

A solid 5-6 months is a decent taking stage length imo😭

Yes but do u have tips for the girlys with lily scalp dry bottom of hair and horrible dandruff if u don’t wash every 2-3 days
"If you have a certain type of hair, it’s not bad to wash it every day if you need to. People with thinner, dryer hair don’t need to as much."
My hair will literally be trained then become immediately untrained the second I wash my hair two days in a row. Then boom greasy overnight again.
Guys it’s ok if you need to wash your hair more often! Not everyones hair is the same and “training” doesn’t always work for everyone!
i feel like i do everything by the book to not have oily hair and it’s STILL oily. idk what to do anymore🥲
i wash my hair every night
i can't even go 24h without my hair getting greasy
help pls my hair is so naturally oily and i can’t even go 2 days without it lookin greasy
can’t go 24 hours w/o it getting greasy
I was my hair once a week every Sunday!! 🫶🏽
I've tried going longer in between washes for months now. my hair is still just as greasy as it was before after day 1
i also go 7 days inbetween and it made life so much easier
On day 5 for like the first time in forever 😭🫶
It gets so itchy 🥺
teach me rn
i wash my hair twice a week
i read somewhere that it's bad for your scalp to wash your hair only once a week 🤔
How do people go without washing hair everyday if you workout everyday and sweat

No one getting the joke 🔥🔥🔥🔥
people make multiple accounts
Y’all trying to be smart makes it so obvious you missed the joke
Kinda throws us off when we repeatedly ask for help and support and yet it’s still our fault in the end. Quit blaming and start supporting.
"It's the way I'm expected to document every behavior fully, even when they are happening 15-20 times an hour. As if I don't have algebra to teach..."
I just HOPE you were a classroom teacher for at least 5 years before saying this 😂😂😂
This gives “Did you form a relationship?” Vibes.
How are interventions possible with overcrowded classrooms and lack of support ? Teachers are drowned by the system. We need help and relief.
I don’t have time to write down goddamn interventions I’m doing on all the kids that need tested. So many hoops and no time to jump through them.
"I don’t expect the school social workers or psychs to teach Calculus, why do you expect me to teach behavior? I’m more maladjusted than the kids."
Kinda like when we refer kids for t2 and t3 supports but student services never does anything or follows up
Until you have to deal with that child behavior all day while trying to teach rigorous lessons So that all students can master their standards😅
"between overcrowding, lack of support, and how much data is needed to actually get help for a kid in need it doesn’t matter because it’s never enough"
The way no one can show me a framework on how to implement interventions 🤷‍♀️
Go in teach for a month and show her how it’s done. We’ll sit back and watch
Tier 1 isn’t interventions. That’s tier 2.
"For me, it’s school psychs who have no classroom experience. With 20+ kids, while being responsible for safety, health & learning of the students."
This attitude is why there's such a division between school psychs and teachers. Start collaborating instead of judging.
In my experience LSSPs don’t take teacher’s opinions into consideration no matter who much data we collect.
We’re too busy cleaning our rooms up after they’ve been destroyed and catching the chairs being thrown at our heads.
I tried to ask which zone of regulation they were in between ducking a flying 🪑 and dodging a jump kick. 🙄😑
My love language is having actual time in the day and staff to accomplish this.

Akita had that death grip
Akita are very powerful dogs
Akita ready for the smoke💨
Akita's are hunting dogs tho? bro squared up the wrong dog
"Japanese use Akita to hunt bears in the past, a fighter is nothing to a killer"
"Also did anyone else notice that the Akita waited for the pit to bite, moved its head up and counter bit. That’s a badass dog"
Akita's are one dog pit bulls have no chance with
"Akita said ""I have 50 million power in Rise of Kingdom"" 🗣️"
Wasn’t a Japanese Akita bred to hunt bears 😭
owner knows what his dog is capable of he didnt even stand up😂
"Just so you know, akitas are very strong and very protective when it comes to their family. They'd even kill for them and die."
Incredible defence to offence positioning
"akitas are breed to take down bears, trust me i had one and they are about that life"
Dude just sat there like this was everyday normal activity 😂😂
"Bro akitas arent normal dogs idk why ppl are shocked, youll see alot of them grow up with gsd’s and other big dogs"

How do I take out the good screws ?
bro has to do that to 5 other bolts 😭
It doesn’t always work that easy.. z
I’m absolutely shocked that first socket attempt didn’t do the trick
okay what was the use of the channel locks?😅😅😅
Now do all that. Everything you just did. Down to the last detail… in space
I really thought the grinder was gonna work damn...
Hardest part is trying to take the reverse bit out of the bolt
I love the wrong tool demo's in the beginnings.
I use gripzilla liquid chalk but i guess this could work too
No... cut a slit with a dremmel and use flathead screwdriver or bit to remove it. Much easier. 😉
Now a video of extracting the extractor 😂
"Throw it at something to knock it loose, u in the field… 😂"
That's a lot
You can just weld the bolt
show us getting it out the broken bolt lol

"i don’t live in colorado, but i do live in nebraska and love to visit🫡 thank you"
Wait I just moved here I need this
Do you know of any spots that allow 10 dogs? We are looking in Colorado Springs area first week of November.
I don’t even live in colorado but FOLLOWED
I’ve been thinking of doing this for months!! It’s such an awesome idea!
Omg can you recommend for other states? My mom has a dog with health issues so he can’t be boarded 😩
This looks so fun
I thought about having my 21st in Colorado and getting an air bnb for a few of my friends and there’s 2 dogs and want to take them hiking
"any airbnb that allows multiple dogs? i want to road trip SO bad but most places only allow one, sometimes two but never three🥺 somewhere near hikes!"
I live in Bailey Colorado and love it
I’ve thought about moving to Colorado but they have so many places I can’t take my dogs.. ajd that’s something we do a TON here in Oregon
What about reactive dogs? 🥺 Which is why I mainly disperse camp with my dog
everything went by so fast
dream school forever😭
Ngl I feel old bc of that
this sent shivers
lol my first spring in college was COVID and now suddenly I'm three months away from graduating
time isn’t real
my summer felt so slow b4 I was off to college and I feel like life has been moving so fast since I’ve started 🫠
Remember to celebrate yourself for all your hard work 🫶
wait until you’re in your 4th year
i definitely did not feel this way about school i was praying all year for the end of it but i’m so glad you fell in love with it
went by soo fast!!!!
It’s the quarter system 😩 we got this though
all of our hard work mann
Crazy to think about that
I still can’t believe that Ive made it this far
makes me realize how fast life goes
I don't get it with fruits and caramel and m&ms topping.worst combination ever.
why doesn’t anyone ever use red apples? 😭 i always seen green apple candy apples.
"For $20, that better be the best damn Carmel apple ever"
"That was so easy, why you charging like $20 a piece"
this apple keep the doctor closer 😂
i would sacrifice my first born to try one of these
I have never in my life eaten a toffee apple
i would pay $8 for that
"oh no. terrible timing to see this. working night, with pregnancy cravings, and now I need to look up how to make caramel apple at home 🙀"
oh you a real fsther
My teeth are cracking just imagining a bite from this apple.
for 20$ i could prolly buy 5 packs of the 3 affy tapples :/
Does this hurt the apple
Red apple and you got a deal!
green apple + caramel ? ughhhh hell no... worst combination
30$? is the caramel melted gold?
"Rubbing alcohol, spay on sunscreen, and old dry erase marker, there’s tons that take off sharpie."
People are really missing the point here LOL
Expo markers take sharpie right off too !! ❤️
What about on fabric tho
i have sharpie still on the wall from when my 5yo (then THREE year old) decided to remodel the living room… maybe i should get some of this 😂
I love using this on our carpets!!! cleans great and cleans the yucky smells in the air as well!
Does it work for pen marks on upholstery
Use toothpaste to remove sharpie
"Baby wipes remove permanent marker, as well"
took red lipstick art off my brand new couch that my 3 year old at the time got out of my purse.
Try it on the wall
Is it heavily scented???
Does it work for crayon
Hand sanitizer takes away sharpie
Does this work on kids stained clothes?
"As someone with sense of smell issues, I HATE the smell of those products."
hand sanitizer also works to get sharpie off things. you can draw over it with dry erase marker too
where can I order it for cheaper than 30$ for 8oz
"the brown cat is like: """"what da hell is wrong wud u"" 🤣🤣🤣"
I would love to know what he's saying. My cats seem too. 😂😂😂😂😂

and that's how it is see
I think that cats on drugs 🤣
„Look i pretend to be a cobra. It is my magic trick. Awesome dude.
The cat from cats and dogs lol 😂
wonder wat she's saying 🥰🥰🥰
when then hypnosis isn't working 😂😂
"honestly that's still saying give them everything you have...nothing left for yourself. Can't do that, sorry. Find balance
Everything is temporary."
"When you are running near empty, take a day off. Don’t grade papers that day, go sit in the park."
Let’s normalize not giving them ALL we have. What about me? What about my son? What do we get? Zero? Nah
What’s left for everything and everybody else? This is what makes it unsustainable.
This the realest things I have seen
Toxic positivity! We keep getting told to give all we have! Why? What are we saving for ourselves and our families?
The kids need 100% of all you got. ❤️
"Huge advice because it’s really realistic to teaching. Life is hard, but we show the kids the opposite."
NO! NO! NO! When you have 30% you take a day or 2 or 3 off and forget the job for awhile. Then you come back when you actually feel better....
"Yes! I always tell myself, if I would grade myself at an 85, that's good enough for us all!"
"except no matter the percentage, if you're giving the kids your all then you're still left with nothing for yourself or family"
"I love the realness of this message. It is temporary, gain the necessary skills and move on"
This is the same rule I have for my kiddos.
😩😩😭😭😭😭 This hit hard!!
Why can’t my principal understand we’re not robots????
45 years here
I love this.

GIRL everyone knows u won the lottery now and u said where ur from🤦🏼‍♀️
"In Australia, the lottery is non- taxable income. So, for example, if you win $100 million you get the full $100 million."
"Dude, you just told the internet you won the lottery :/"
Taxes!? On the lottery? That’s very unfair America
"""hi, I just won the lottery and here's where I live"" 😮‍💨😮‍💨"
She sat in the lobby. Verified the ticket. Where she got it. Asked if she wanted the whole amount or the taxes amount. She chose taxed amount. Done.
She won 35k
You’re not broke enough. I would’ve dropped everything in my life to head to the office.
$5 scratcher won $50k got $35k after taxes bought a house
Congratulations 😁
In Sweden lottery winnings are tax free 😁
The wait time is so they can check for back child support or state taxes if your state has that because they will take all or part of winnings to
"Parents won $38,000 from a boardering state's lotto. They drove the ticket to the capital city and then had to wait 6 weeks for a paper check"

Why am I watching this AS I’m leaving my house 🥲 I don’t feel the worst because I got two dogs so they keep each other company 😭 but still
My dog is coming everywhere now

I miss tucson so much .
I finna see ppl in these comments I either know or know of 😂
My pup was so confused today lol!!
It’s was so magical this morning
Is the earth warming or not
Wow! How often does that happen? Looks pretty!
It was such a surprise but now it’s gone 💀
It was so gorgeous!!! All gone now 😭😭
Morning
God I MISS TUCSON 🥺 Wish I could go back but I can’t take the heat like I use to when I was a kid 🥺
Ooooo I love the snowy desert!
i was gonna comment “obviously” but apparently its not so obvious bc of these comments💀💀
I think some of the societal talk around manipulation confuses regular communication of needs and wants as manipulation
Doing A to get B isn’t manipulation 😭 that’s how action reaction works. Always. They don’t understand. They’re just scared and can’t help themselves.
I got told my newborn was manipulating me like no he isn’t
Literally someone told me that children & dogs can manipulate adults and that I should take a psychology class 😭
“they’re not trying to give you a hard time they’re just HAVING a hard time”
you gotta go through a million classes to possibly adopt a kid but if you DIY they're just like welp 🤷 good luck I'm sure you're more than qualified
Also older people who manipulate learned to do that because they weren’t getting their needs met…
this. my parents thought i was lying about abuse and manipulating them. i didn’t even know lying about abuse was a thing 💀
"Also if a older kid/child (that is not yours, like babysitting or daycare) is “manipulating you” it’s the parents fault, not the kid’s"
Bruh young kids don’t know what manipulation is but they sure as hell know certain things get reaction outta parents
"they act like things like attention/play arent needs and dont provide them then think it's ""manipulative"" when kids try other ways to get those things"
The problem starts when people dehumanize kids as things to be managed. They are ppl even when upset
You can’t spoil babies/kids by providing their basic needs!! I hate hearing about how snacks/holding a baby/etc. is gonna spoil
some ppl in these comments don't know how to read oh my lawd
"my heart breaks for all of us who were told that and are adults now, realizing we were never naturally manipulative, just in need of our parents love"
i was taught babies can manipulate moms by crying for cuddles. like HUH????? ITS A BABY. IT KNOWS NOTHING
"HEAVY on the learning about infant, child and teen development"
every time id have some sort of emotional reaction around my stepdad i would be accused of manipulation and of faking it
I took a human growth & dev class in college and the ENTIRE time all I could think ab was how many children suffer bc of the lack of BASIC knowledge
TIGER?
why no one talks about tiger

"I’m gonna have so many divorces in my life if I took your advices, I better start calling myself Ross 🥹"
"Gurl, it’s 2023. If he wants to he will. And it’s important to live together 1st so you know the relationship will last once it passed the honeymoon"
"yeah but you are implying that we want to get married, which is not true"
"I just know there's more , tag me in part 2!!"
"I moved in with my now husband while we were dating. Honestly, I’d never marry a man I didn’t live with. That’s just asking for issues"
I disagree with most of these. Sorry!
20th century just called looking for you 🤣🤣🤣
NO THANK YOU! These rules work for some NOT EVERYONE. Me and my bf moved in together and we are closer than ever and know all more abt each other w-
"what she said is completely out of logic like wdym girl ""we'll figure it out if it works living togheter or no"" and if it doesn't? wyd?divorce?😂"

I disagree with this so much... if you don't live with a person before marriage and don't know them properly you'll definitely have issues after
im glad that it work for you but every relationship works different 🫶🏽
There is no such thing as wife/gf privilege what you are saying is play games. When you're in a partnership you give 150%
I swear I moved in with my now ex worst mistake of my ENTIRE LIFE.

"As a 911 dispatcher I can tell you her “are you sure they’re ours?” Was a “d*mn it, my units are being special again.”"
Former 911 dispatcher here. We know they will freeze to death trying to dig themselves out before they call for help.
We are so “Minnesota Nice” 😊 Love this so much!! 🥰
but.... did she get her tickets?! I neeeed to know!🥰
I towed a cop out of a ditch after he cited me for chains in a Texas ice storm. He tore up the ticket!🤣
Police have a radio to contact dispatch with. They were intentionally keeping it to themselves to avoid embarrassment😂
the fire department appreciated the radio traffic more than the police dept
Why’d you gotta snitch? 😂 we don’t put embarrassing stuff like this over the radio unless 100% needed 😂
But did you give her tickets?!
"Good thing you called it in, definitely no way for the squad to ask for help on their own 😂"
so did you give her tickets for her birthday???
are you sure it is one of ours like what are their imposters the public isn't being told about
Thank you to @samsansevere @kiak102 @itsmikedubs for their part in the rescue mission. 😂

PTO = Prepare The Others
Don't live to work; work to live.
my pto and my employees pto gets approved automatically. idec why. I took pto because Hogwarts Legacy came out that whole week
if it's months in advance there's 0 reason for a denial you should ezly be able to make a new schedule. if you can't make one with months of time then
every job I ever worked I told them I don't do a point system and if I need a day off there's a reason and I'm not going to be there 😅
Thats why i love amazon PTO is automatically approved 😂
Should check your company’s policy handbook.
Rule #1 of how to get fired
Work ethic has gone down the drain so much it’s not even funny…
how to get fired 101
Tell me why I experienced almost every video you post 💀
this is how I am at work 🤣
I told my job when I started “on this day don’t put me down on the schedule cuz I will not walk in that door”
Sounds like the conversation I had back in October about my vacation plans in April and she stilll tried to put me on the schedule to work
this is how I approach the topic. I do not need approval to take time off. I am selling MY time to you. you pay me for that time. it is MY TIME!
what's the point of personal time of off if you have to give the reason.
I just take the day off if I feel like it and I have the hours available.
Until 2 employees are off at the same time and they hire a new person to cover then there aren’t enough hours when everyone is back
"We went through PTO process during hiring, unexcused absence."
"took vacation to Galveston, told I'ma be off 6 months I'm advance, was called all weekend because someone quit and jumped me in line for on call"
"little kid was booking, legs don't fail me now."
2nd one was Mariah Carey 😂😂
I love these vids🤣🤣🤣🤣💯
More with kids😅
This helped me understand this trend so much 😳😍

That’s dope!
I love this!
It's his face as well when he tells the joke. Our family loves watching him 🥰
Why did no one in the room start wheezing
his voice is so cute 😂❤️
😂😂 too cute🥰
my fave joke. what do you call a deer with no eyes and no legs - still no idea.😂
He’s definitely not old enough for the third joke in the series but let’s hear him do the second one.
He's too adorable 🥰🥰!!!
What if the deed also has no legs?!!? Still no eye deer!
That’s so cute 🥰

"I'm still lost on step one, where do i find me some raw milk!!"
we don't have raw milk here and no one sells it. not like SC where I could get it anywhere🥺
I used to make this for my family when I was a teenager. And now want to get back into it! Hopefully everything will come back to me!
hbThe crepitation of firecrackers sends off the old year. Sweet wine and spring wind brings warmth into thousands of homes.s
for those wondering where to get raw milk in your area I just posted a video yesterday about a source you can use to search for a provider. I'm about

farmers cheese is good it reminds me of making mozzarella with my mom as a kid
anyone know what song this is?
I do this all the time as well
my family is off the boat Italian. they have been preppers and living that life since coming here. we still do this. 😉
How much cheese do you get from a gallon
plz teach me
I can make farmers cheese but mozzarella seems to hate me 😭
I’m going to be trying to make Farmers cheese today. Hope it works
what if it's local but not raw and not homogenized
"how well will it turn out not raw?
farmers in my area are charging $15/half gallon 😑"
I am having a hard time finding raw milk for purchase. Any suggestions?
Yes please teach me.
Not the takis being bread rolls
Why r they soft💀
That one chip challenge looks like styrofoam😭😭

Bro just spray painted a tortilla
Bro litterly drunk so much water

Bro’s toilet finna be lit tonight

How r u not verified yet but @ig0 is...
That giant chip didn’t even have the dark powder😂

Bro there painted tortillas
Since when we’re there green takis
@lyte since when r giant takis a thibg
That’s exactly how it would go 😂
Only real ones know this is a repost
I sure wish that was a real thing
Shoulda known he meant to say Chicken Piccata obviously 🙄
Now you’re giving us ideas. 😂Love it!
"Omg, I wish we could wear those!!!! 😂"

What’s bugging you the most is that the ppl you drop everything for don’t do the same for you. I feel you! 💯
Girl where is your appt? I’m in Houston I’ll go sit there and watch her so you feel comfortable.
I felt this !!!
There should be a daycare area in the salons for all the mommas 🥰❤️
I drop everything for everyone and always gets pushed last from others. Keep your head up! You got this I wish I lived closer to you I would help you.
girl I’m so sad for you I’m like sitting here saying “I can watch her!!! My daughter and her can be besties” 😂😂
AND THATS WHY I’m gonna hire someone at my salon to help babysit my kids and my clients kids while I do their hair 😁
As a hairstylist I appreciate how much respect you have for our business 🫶🥺 feel for you because sometimes even rescheduling ruins your plans
I FELT THIS IN MY SOUL
I always have schedule my hair appointments on my husband’s day off for this reason.
The “well don’t do it for them” uhhh hits hard
Take your kids with you and explain to her that your sitter canceled on you
I felt this 🥺😭😭
as a hairstylist this is why i let my clients bring their kids if needed. i’m sorry this happened to you & thank you for being so caring/thoughtful
"this is off topic… I recently started following you and I luv your content, where are your earrings from?💖"
Some people do this on purpose just cus they don’t want to see you happy or looking good girl.
"Nahh us moms who don’t have a village, we get it mama. I’m so sorry you missed out on this opportunity. Hoping it turns around 🥺💗"
Try to find a drop off daycare in your area for emergencies like this! I found one in Austin that’s basically a gym daycare without a gym. I’m sorry
Felt this!!! Hope you were still able to get your hair done despite the setbacks🫶🏽
I’m legit crying with you because I know exactly how this feels..
"He found the power, but at what cost"
It would have been perfect if you hadn't put it up his...
The way he put that thing😳
He had the most hardest moment
“And then something just snapped”
No wonder he’s screaming
"“BULMA, I would like try something different tonight”"
I’d scream too
that spot was the winner?
"this is wrong, at so many levels 😂😂"
"Well, that's gonna hurt"

I was confused and just looked it up n will confirm we are not supporting Walgreens ever
i was wondering why all the women at my local Walgreens quit omg
As a pharm tech at Walgreens. I ain’t even getting hours rn and I want to quit. This is a sign
Not just the pills either! They ignored concerns from a teenage employee who was killed by an older coworker.
I've always been a CVS girly
walgreens was a terrible company when i worked for them im so glad i quit 😭
walgreens also gave me a $3 raise. i had it for 3 MONTHS then they said it was a mistake & took it away 😑 this happened to a bunch of people too
walgreens is bad but cvs isn’t much better😭😭
bruh last time i was there the pharmacist gave a 17 year old oxys by accident instead of amoxicillin HOW DO U DO THAT
I transferred all of my prescriptions away & closed my rewards from them on Monday. We don’t play on women’s rights.
WHAT HAPPENED PLS TELL ME
WHAAAT HAPPENED TO WALGREENS??? Please soemoene inform me
I’m confused what happened
my mom worked at walgreens and literally got assaulted and they fired her and the dude 😒
Someone explain the Walgreens situation
Walgreens just shaking in there boots at this tiktok
You already dead at 30mph
I’m surviving all those. Just gotta duck
I’m surviving all these
the way it just kept getting faster😭
but what if I wear my seatbelt
You're still coming at work right?
dude I got the point at 50mph no need for 300mph🤔
My toxic trait tells me I can survive 300mph💀
I survived that 300mph trust me bro

You know the worker picked Beckham just to teach Brady a lesson too and I love it
That must happen a lot to him. he didn't complain and gave up at the first moment he came in.
The way we would have gone home after Brady
Now why wouldn’t they let him do it 🙄
Can we get Beckham by himself at Disneyland next time 😭

#45 Morris is the truth. They would not have won without her.

This is great teammate leadership the media dont show#Lets Go Angel
THAT IS RIGHT ANGEL. IF SHE IS TRYING TO GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL. SHE IS TELLING HER YOU HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT
But this is what makes @angelreese10 great! She has been doing this all season long for her team.

Okay but the tip taps of the hangers was so satisfying
Me with one 2 pairs of shoes and 1 jacket:👁👄👁
How do you do this? I’m struggling with my closet
Time for a sneakerbox from Sneakerboxshop 😳
This was so satisfying to watch Ty🫶🏼🫶🏼

Shin guards and a mask….I’m in
Easy money
Good point
"I personally don’t want to, but up it to a grand and I’m in. Played slow pitch for years. I could catch 1 of 3. Hand wouldn’t be happy though."

"I don’t have Costco, but I use my moms sams club membership. They have the card in app for scanning and no picture attached 🫡"
"I used to work at Costco, tell them the persons in the bathroom"
in this economy??? i am one person i WILL be using my parents membership
Why do they act like it’s a social security card?
Yeah they did this to me when my dad was in the hospital and my mom needed me to pick up an air purifier
"""yeah I know she is in line for pizza or in the bathroom "" lol"
Ha! I don't even think the person at sam's LOOKS at the card. my brother has had mine for over 2 years 😂
If your mom has a card and hasn’t assigned anyone to the free second card then she can add you on
Sams club would never 😂
I went with a couple friends and we all just kept passing my card down the line till we all checked out 😅
People when Costco tries to enforce the membership fee that allows them to keep their prices low in the first place 😦
I use my dads card they didn’t care even when I went through regular checkout. It depends if the cashier is on a power trip tbh
The general public when membership-based stores have rules about those memberships and pay people to enforce those rules 🤯🤯🤯
Had that problem until they opened the self checkout lines 😎
Hiii I work at costco and we’re literally just doing our jobs when we say that 🙃
I have my mom’s second card
my mom's boyfriend and my husband look identical so they just used his picture lolsauce
I don't go to places that charge me for shopping there.

So how were they able to keep the mace ball in the air? Did they green screen that out?
What the heck is the ball hanging from? What force tears that down?
I want to what kind of cable holds that ball. I am putting it on my winch.
Dude how are these made! They look too real lol

But I’m white🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️you are an embarrassment to Mexicans. Mexicans are not all dark pigment.
The the only all Mex in my house.😂 The cat: MEXICAN😂
She said your Mexican!! Welcome to the family!!
"Cute, but your saying mexican and white? My wife is white but her background is Czech so we tell our kids Mexican/Czech."
She was done arguing 😂
"when my daughter like 3, we were at a restaurant and she said she was half Mexican & half human."
My daughter is half white and says she's can't be Mexican cause she can't speak Spanish. I tell her she's half Mexican cause am Mexican.
This little girl is going to be a star
She’s so cute
@makayla_bullis this gonna be my grand baby
don't confused her lol 😂
@vaqueraadrianna she so cute tho
My daughter says the same thing
"All my kids tell me I’m Mexican even though I’m not they’re like mama you’ve been with this family 19 years, you’re Mexican 😂😂😂"
It would have been even more funny if this was actually spontaneous and her reaction wasn’t completely scripted.
And to think this was the best take.
imagine if we could get a video where irs not rehearsed
Marvelous 😂😂😂😂😂
SHE JUST HAPPENS TO COME IN AT THE RIGHT SECOND 😂
I remember 1990 when people still read the paper
She looked everywhere except for in front of her? 😂😂😂😂

I love living with my friends and living like we are a lil family. The intimacy of knowing them so deeply down to the sauces they love and hate 🥹🥹🥹

I wonder if barnacles itch as bad as I think they do.
I will never touch barnacles. Never.
It makes my skin crawl to see barnacles on them
everyone be careful touching barnacles. If you have a cut and touch one or cut yourself on one it can grow on you! Apparently it's excruciating.
They def need to hit up Oscar’s whale wash where you get a hell of a wash and the price OH MY GOSH
Do barnacles hurt whales? I saw an episode of a show where a guy had a barnacle growing in him and he said it was excruciating
barnacles dont hurt whales directly but they do house lice which feed on the whales.
As someone who grew up on beaches and getting cut by barnacles regularly your not going to have them attach to you like this😂
CANT WE START A PROGRAM TO SCRUB THEM CLEAN OF BARNACLES? Lets jump in and help them!
my door when everyone at the house is sleeping
the fact it understood to come up more out of the water so he could get more off. wow. what an intelligent creature
I hate barnacles with my whole life
He actually moved when you motioned him too! 😍
Finally someone peeling the barnacles off!! Yes!!!
Whales breach usually to help remove barnacles
Ughh the sounds is so lovely
FINALLY someone who picks the barnacles off instead of just petting them 🥰
Just get a mega sized cheese grater lol
when you told him to come here he raised up. that's amazing

We did this last week we had 3 horses with us we got off tho cause one of the 3 we had was a big one so we walked them though and sized them for shoes

And here I thought you were saving someone from dying in fishing wire

"What's the point. Take everything, especially the fishing wire, so that the other fish don't get strangled therein."
At least collect the 😳fishing line as well 😂
❤️Clean the Oceans❤️

Because schools are not prisons?
"I went to the SSA last month. 6 doors, no guards, no wands and no detectors sparky."
"Listen to this, can’t get much clearer"
Get rid of the guns u Taliban extremists
Those are adults kids don’t need feel like they learning in maximum security prison
because kids shouldn't go to school in a prison so that you can feel like an actual man.
Yeah….. that’s exactly what our 5 year olds should experience daily. Those are precious memories
Same with courthouses. Children should be protected above all
or ban high capacity weapons
we all must demand security for every child
I’m south ga all schools have Sheriff deputy’s at the school
"Why could we not have reinforced, ballistic rated, doors, increased closed circuit video, two armed guards. How much did we send to Ukraine???"
1: they can’t afford to pay teachers 2: they can’t afford to feed kids 3: they can’t afford books and materials 4: they can’t afford proper schools
because shooters just storm the schools. why not enforce stricter gun laws?
"Security was present at Parkland, Michigan & Uvalde. Pulse nightclub had police security! Tell me again how armed security stops mass shootings🙄"
"Yeah, this is what we want kids to go through when they want to learn…. 😏😏😏 Get a grip"
Because they don’t care about kids or teachers
Shows they don't care about the kids.
Because we have no control of our government
Haha me every time
Trust me I’ll find a way to break it
Musical chairs💀
my class would break that within 5 seconds
Bro it looks like those clear plastic fork

Imagine sitting in the passenger seat and the person behind you mmoves your seat
Why do rich people drink so much?
I love how I’m watching this knowing I’ll never see one again
"Starting at 340,500 😳 I know it’s a luxury car but lort"
that car just told me I was poor in 20 different ways😳😳😳
So In some states no one in the vehicle can drink. So since it’s a rolls Royce can I have a roadie then or how does that work?
I would have a war with the person in passenger seat moving it up and down
I wish I was rich😭
Cup holders are way too small how is it ever gonna fit my double gulp cup
Did no one get the Fairly Odd Parents joke? “IF I HAD SOME”
imagine hitting a pot hole while you're in the back sipping
Champagne floooots 😂😂😂
oh how i love rich people
Since when does Carbuzz film at the baseball field in winter springs that I film at 😳
"I’ll never have enough money for this car but like, why does it seem so cramped?"
They should remake the Colossus of Rhodes
Where they at now? Did somebody check the British museum?
pyramid of giza is the only one left
7 wonders of the ancient world
The hanging gardens would’ve been so beautiful
Colossus of Rhodes wasn’t straddling the harbor it was just standing much like Statue of Liberty
"It's mind blowing if you think about how people back then, without technology and equipment, built those wonders"
can we make them exist again pretty please 😭
We can rebuild them we have the technology
"7 ancient wonders. There are 7 natural and 7 modern wonders that still very much exist. Also, the pyramids don’t exist?"
Almost all are Greek
i climbed the lighthouse of alexandria in assissins creed origins😂
Colossus freaks me out
They all somehow ended up at the British Museum
man why did they fall or did people take them away it still would be cool if it was still here
Assassin’s Creed players visited them 😁😁
why not rebuild
"Weren’t there 2 smaller pyramids next to the pyramid of Giza, and weren’t they his sons pyramid and his sons son/ grandson pyramid?"
Lovely 🥰
why want a white dog😳😱🤩🤣🤣
"Oh, soo charming 😍"
Only happiness and love 🙏🏻🥰🥇💞💞💞
How many times have I watched this? Yes.
"Me too, then I found Islam. This year was also my first Ramadan. May Allah bless your life even more💗"
I reverted to this year and experienced Ramadan as a new Muslim and I absolutely loved it
New convert here also amiga
Felt this on so many levels!
u look like a Disney princess mA
"I’m trying to learn about Islam, where do I start? 💕"
I converted last year and I’ve never felt better
I’m Dominican 🇩🇴 and Muslim. I absolutely love Islam.
May Allah make it easy for u and if u have any questions please reach out
May Allah make it easy for u 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
May Allah make it easy for you
"Can someone make a revert group? I’m currently from Spain and thinking about reverting, I would love support from ppl that were in my situation ♥️"
you obviously didn’t know much because the Trinity isn’t separate Gods. God is one
"Me too, i saw a dream where i am reciting shahadah as i am dying while i didn't even know nothing about it or arabic"
"I’m converting but it’s very hard to learn all the prayers, is it okay to pray 2 or 3 times a day until I learn all of the prayers?"
"MASHALLAH, I just did Ramadan for the first time too, been Christian over 20 years and converted on Eid to Islam, there were too many inconsistencies"
Allahumma barik that’s amazing! Lmk if you need help at all <333
So so happy for you 🥹❤️
i don't wanna know what's going on
why does everybody tag #theweeknd? this song is by #mariowinans
Love it
My only talent is breathing
This is not the weeknd. This is Mario. 😉
your so pretty🥰
song name please
хз я чую: I tried so hard and got so far. but in the end it doesn't even matter.
Linkin Park - in the and
"I've tried so hard and come so far, but in the end, it doesn't even matter, I had to fall to lose it all, but in the end, it doesn't even matter."
It just wraps the tether around a baby seal’s neck and flies home
So basically it's going to be like fishing line but on land hanging from trees
so basically it's being holded by the thing
"And then it marks the gps coordinates and someone collects the tether, or is it a litter bot?"
very clever
what if someone nets it?
He didn’t say bulletproof 😂😂😂😂😂
Yea we all love drones flying above us. A world with more drones than good paying jobs 👎.
Why physically go somewhere and do something when you can potentially litter and stay on the couch?😃
Bird shot
that's a drone bud
So it's tied to the wheel... it's not just freely there
how about if I throw the line into the propeller
"so if I can catch the tether, then I get a free tether**"
So if I wanted to steal the box I could
So in the future there just gonna be string everywhere lol
“Why don’t I get to pick” 🤓 Sheldon always thinks its about him

Imagine being fired right after your job orientation 😂😂😂
Gucci: not today babes!. FIRED!. 💀
Working at luxury stores is the best I still have all my Tory Burch uniforms 🤣 plus commissions were like … 1500+ biweekly checks 🤑
Was it worth doing a TikTok and getting fired over it? 😩
The cackle I’ve just let out especially because I JUST saw the video about the Gucci employee being fired 😭😂
Why are people hating that she’s flexing her work uniform? It’s cute. 💅🏽
It was the shade throwing though 😂😭😭 no wonder she got fired.

"Sometimes when you work at a retail stores , or clothing stores would give you free gratis items to wear to work"
That green blouse looks so goooood on you
The uniforms are not made in the same factory as regular clothing and you will have to give everything back once you quit 🫡
So do you have to give them back if you leave or??? 🤔
I am here after watching the other vid on how she was fired 😭😂

the people taking the money are so embarrassing 😂
I get so embarrassing for them when they try to just take it 😭😭😭💀💀💀
I wonder if they were annoyed with some of the people
is nobody talking about how she broke her foot??😭

did Lily try to do the laundry with her leg?? what happened😳😂😂
How she broke her leg ?
Is she ok 😅
What happened to her leg
she was hard at that laundry if she broke her leg overnight😭
Randomly broke her foot in the process of doing laundry
she broke her leg doing that mission
The fact that some people just reach and grab the money and try to pull it out there hand 💀
bro the people that try to just take the money make my blood boil
the way they zoomed in on her foot😭
Is it AreYouKiddingTV?
Just no questions on how she broke her leg???
Why are people saying 85k is a small profit? When is the last time they made a lump sum of 85k lol
When I first seen it and the price.. instantly thought omg you won wow
How are people saying $85k isn’t much profit? That’s more than most make in a years salary lol
New to all this so correct me if I’m wrong… but this doesn’t seem like a flip that was worth it for such a small profit..
Not me singing along with the song because this renovation got me hype 😅 I love it 😍
Wish everyone would put this much love and thought into renovations!
"The profit was about 85 , 86,000 so I feel like you spent more money on renovations, but 85,000 is 85,000"
200k for rennovations?! 👏🏽Amazing.
When I seen the 200k renovations I just KNEW this house was going to be beyond beautiful 😍👏🏾 y’all did that !
And that’s investment 🫶🏽 love to see this
How do you get the money for the renovations? I wanna flip a house but the renovations are so much😩
"85k profits but 200k in renovations, correct me if I’m wrong that’s a lost right? Besides that the house looks beautiful"
The bathroom floor 🤌🏻
The comps in this area had to be extremely high! Great flip 🏡
🔥🔥🔥. Beautiful work!
That’s awesome. How long did it take you to renovate?
Do you all not know what a profit is. They made the money they bought the house with plus the money they renovated it with back and had almost 90kback
Unfortunately when they get older and need a wheelchair they will wish it was solid sidewalk
Hear me out….black trim on the house
Looks so good.! Gotta paint your window trim and door black now 😍 it’ll be a vibeeeee
What if you painted the pavers black 🤔
He was getting around to it!
Mulch glue for the rocks! Or else kiddos are going to play with them lol
"I've seen videos with ""mulch glue"" if you want all the rocks to stay in the same place!"
I heard of people gluing down the rocks too. 🤷‍♀️(no rocks ever getting in grass or on top of cement steps)
Gorgeous.
I really like those black rocks! They will be added to my list for sure
I just recently did a rock garden. A tiny one. So I know this was an expensive project! I kept needing more bags 😭
"looks great. fun to put LED lights under the rocks so u can change colors at night. After time, stain and seal and look like glass."
use mulch glue to keep the rocks down!!
you should use mulch glue to hold the little rocks in place
I saw someone glue their rocks down so they didn’t move out of place & it looked awesome!
Beautiful! Time to paint the house to match !
I heard those rocks fade soon after it rains🥺
Looks really good.
I CANT EACAPE YOUNG SHELDON😭😭😭
"😂😂😂😂😂 is she cute?
sheldon: compared to what? 💀"
"""Sheldon Lee Cooper, you dawwwg😏"""
he really asked “compared to what?” 😂😂
Georgie being a proud brother cuz missy told him about reproduction😭
"Tam, we’re eating"
memaw is giving me joy😅
"""I don't know what more beautiful ur eyes or ur mind""
the best pick up line😂😂😂"
the gf is truly older to be honest....
"""I'm both threatened and delighted by your brain"" - plain truth."
Sheldon Lee Cooper you Dawg🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 love Meemaw❤
missy is my all time fav..i wish there was different series for missi only 😂🥰
If only George had that reaction with Georgie💀
"Dad: Is she cute?
Son: Compared to what? 🤣🤣😂"
Grandma's reaction😆😆😆😆
bro uses mittens to touch his family but touches silver wear that they all touch
missy:I told him😌😊 *proud ash*
Eleventh?! 🤨
You noticed he watched how you closed it lol. Just a matter of time before he opens it lol
If these company’s would just make all dog food bags with zip locks at the top - it would make our lives much easier!!!
Thought that was a trash can 💀
Yep that’s the way to do it keep it in the bag and store in a container. DO NOT empty bag into container the plastic container will poison the kibble
Where did you get this to hold the dog food?!?
yeah it's fab but it's $148
where you get dog food container 🥰
where you buy it
Where can I get this dog food storage container?
Husky be like: Here… hold my kibble. Watch this!
You were really tried by those scissors ✂️🤣🤣
That’s awesome
I’ve got to try something. My dog hardly ever eats one year old female labrador
Kinda defeat’s the purpose when you keep it in the bag
where did you get that bin from
Is this pretty good dry dog food to buy
what size is this container?
How dose it open or dose it open the same way
she’s so me
On a real note: I did the same thing for months and just now found out I have a level 6 vitamin d deficiency
It’s called a stress nap 😫😫
She’s so real for that
you know sometimes i feel more tired when i get too much sleep 🤷🏼‍♀️
She’s me frfr
i woke up at 3 and i’ve been sleeping periodically all day
she’s so real for that
I love her
This was me then found out I was seriously sick. Get blood work fr
I felt this with my entire soul
TAKE THE WHEEL OFF ❌ CUT THE WHEEL AND WASTE IT ✅
bro didn't save himself a 150 bucks😤
rich people experiments ...the only experiment I can do is try to see how long I can last while holding my breath 🤦
Ooof. Watching that tire slash was brutal. (I had to replace some cery expensive tyres this last month due to punctures😳😂

"You lost it all when you said......""faux tree""...."
Your floors are beautiful! Details please 😁
"I Got those exact same glasses from Amazon! $40 for 6 🤭Beautiful home, nonetheless! 😍"
Did the “faux tree” come from crate & barrel?🥰
Drop the link for the faux tree!
Your front door just called me poor 😂
"Love the front door, can I please ask you where did you get the door handle from?"
Lovely. I hate artificial flowers and plants though.
I love the kids “I never knew his dad was a soldier” “he survived the whole war” this to too precious
When he says “oh daddy” I lost it
The little kid in the e back talking 😂 and the shhhh
The way he couldn’t even keep running towards his Daddy because he was so overcome with emotion. This choked me up. 🥹❤️
That reaction I admit as a grown man… man me instantly burst out in uncontrollable tears.. wishes I had someone that happy to see me 🥰
These make me cry every single time
The kid in the back said “I didn’t know his dad was smart” 😂🤣 I love kids man 😂😂 precious video 🫶🏻🙏🏻
That's where you realize when a child needs a parent's protection.🥰
I’m crying 🥺
Am I the only one who doesn’t like it happening at school in front of everyone? At least for me I would feel so uncomfortable crying in front of
That is beautiful
"i love the kid in the background saying ""I didn't know his dad was a soldier"" my heart ❤️"
I know the feeling 🥹

how was only one person smart enough to start with green
guys the ball color has to correspond with the plate thingy 😭
thing
I don’t know if it’s just me but Lauren Is so pretty
Lauren calculated the trajectory for each ball
"Lauren always wins these! Trivia, not so much."
Took me too long to realize the colors gotta match 😭
why dont they put green first cuz blue just blocks green 🤨
Brian putting his arm half way across the table🙄
What is this game called?
It took me till taylor to realize the color matching
People that don’t realize they have to get it on the same color
This is more like Lauren’s type of game instead of ? Trivia
You have to match the colors
ohhh its color coordinated
Y’all they got zero bc u have to match the colors up
The winner always fr reaches their arm over no matter what
They have to match the colors
That 1st poke just fore play or?
Watching that is more entertaining than watching actual golf
"gd, nothing about golf is intriguing."
the paint is such a great touch. wish my home course did this
What is the purpose of the initial poke with the red tool?
I don't even watch golf but I viewed this 10 times.
How often does the hole location change?
"yesss, love a painted rim"

Cool tricks but I need to be Einstein to remember them all
Wouldn’t the eggplant eventually rot? Lol
Good content I think but it’s too fast to absorb
Don’t ever do that copper wire trick to electrical connections unless you want a fire in your house 🔥
I already forgot how to do it
"I'm so smittened, I need to learn all of that. I get stuck in the how it works stage."
That eggplant (aubergine) got me wondering what my gal is doing. Imma call her.
So I show up to the Job with Egg Plants in my Tool Belt 🤣
This is honestly one of THE most therapeutic things I've ever seen lol
This is why I LOVE TIKTOK
TikTok needs a setting that allows users to slow down playback speed. I could use some of the ideas if I had more time to comprehend what I see.
Workshop home made tools awesome

that would be good for shrimp just not fish. that bio load would be too much without a filter
"Just casually out here killing fish. Sheese, brutal 😳"
Rip fishies
The amount of people that have never done water changes for a fish tank with no filter amazes me😂😂
Tell me why I asked “can they breath” when he put the lid on
it’s beautiful but even a betta fish without a filter when they’re sold as fish who can live without one is NOT GOOD
How will their water be okay without a filter and heater?
The plants will filter it but only for like 3 of those fish
what seeds for that and where did you get them?
How do you clean it tho 😳
How do you clean it
"yes, and anyone can also learn the melt on those is going to be wild😅"
Where did you get that jar
Could you please tell us how you change the water?
Do maybe tiny snails instead of fish
where is the jar/base/ball from?
what's the name of the sand
@yourtypicalarab can you make one

his legs are tired from too much work 😅😂
"17 Wives, 84 children
he is building an ARMY"
I bet he doesn’t even know half of them
17 wives and 84 children; is it Guinness World Record? 😂😂😂
He may laugh but he doesn’t realise how much trouble that one wife in the west can cause
Now I understand how 7 billion became eight billion😅
isn't 4 is the limit in islam religion?😭

“i have 1 wife..” “one😂 😂😂 “ 🤣🤣🤣🤣
All them thrusts dislocated his hip
That wrong limit is 4
The laugh killed me!!!😂😂😂
If that man know that I don't have any then he will die because of laughter 😅😅🤣🤣
I couldn't remember all their names 😂 17 😂
I now understand why he's on crunches😂😂😂😂😭😭😭
But Islam allow us 4 wife's then how 17🤔🤔
😂😂😂😂😂 one wife 😂😂😂
Sorry to say but he is not allowed to have more than 4 😳
Where did you get all those things? They're so cute!!!!

"My dad is 60 has never used used sunscreen or anything and he has no wrinkles, i think it's genetics🥰🥰"
I’m convinced I need to buy the beauty of Joseon now lol
"The Beauty of Joeson gave me acne. So i think it may not be oily, acne prone skin friendly 😩"
Are any of these mineral sunscreens?
"do you have any mineral recs for brown skin? My skin can’t handle chemical sunscreens 😭. I currently use @livetinted one, works great, doesn’t sting"
Also I ordered the @livetinted invisible sunscreen stick 😅 I will do a review on it when it comes in 🥰 I have high hopes for it!!
Any review about dr v Inzincable? I saw lots of her vedios for sunscreen for brown skin and I am scared to use other but it’s expensive with shipping
Are those physical (mineral) or chemical sunscreen?
The watermelon one has fragrance and 3 ingredients not FDA approved yet
Sunscreen on your eyes?? Does that not irritate your eyes?? Bc I use a moisturizer with spf and that still makes my eyes watery by the end of the day
where can get these
were you buy it
Thank you for this video!!!

OMG I thought this was @shannonsinghhh
How do reapply sunscreen when you have makeup on??
Where can I get the watermelon one .
Cabbage is so underrated. One of my favourite foods.
"Love cabbage, but cabbage and eggs … No one will want to be around you a few hours later"
"I'm a hispanic from So. Tx. and we sautee chopped cabbage, tomato, onion, & serono. Then we mix in eggs. It's so good. Repollo y Huevo Ala Mexicana 😋"
Fried cabbage is better when slicing them as thin as possible
You’re meant to use cabbage in coleslaw
that cabbage 🥬 really looks good.
I miss cabbage 🥰
cabbage and eggs! everyone is so creative 😂
except cabbage what else can we add? thanks.
You cut the cabbage and didn’t rinse it in salt water. How do you know there isn’t a worm or two in it?
The sound of cabbage being cut and sliced is just ahhhh 💙👌🏻
the yellow one scares me
the pink girl was the best
"the girl in silver is a ready made performer,she owns the stage😁"
"everyone sleeping on yellow, when she's the most vocally consistent.... go yello go"
This was cute.. I think I actually preferred the voice of the girl in yellow..
"Silver has SO MUCH potential when she’s older, but the pink is so cute"
the girl In the silver is the best
I love the hook in pinks voice
All great but #3 Hits different 💯
the one in yellow is a little Cyndi lauper
Love this song .

Bros walking with zest
I find it so interesting that as humans we have such serious traditions and rituals that we hold so much sentiment towards.
this is so intimidating in person but it was fascinating at the same time
When I went the Garuda buckle broke and he had to pretend it wasn’t broken it was so cool to see how he could recover from a mess up like that
Y’all ever seen the silent drill platoon? Their precision is amazing

Where in the world are you making 23 as a tech
has to be California or NY maybe because I make $30 as a bsn nurse in Florida 👀
I’m a CNA and I make $13
Where do you make $23/hr. I’m a Patient Care Technician in Mississippi and it’s literally taken me 3 years to make $13/hr 👀
For everyone wondering I live in Tennessee and I work 3 days a week 12 hours shifts 😁
Everyone saying $23 as a tech. I was traveling and was making $36 as an aid
what tell me why i did a 5 month program with clinical’s

the PCT and CNAS are the same in my hospital
I’m a PCT and make $16 with $1 night differential 🥲
I make this as a nurse 😳
The first one that came up on Google in my area said $11-18 with cna certification required 🧍🏻‍♀️
"good luck, depends on area"
They make $17 where i live 🥲
10/10 highly recommend!!!! PCT here!!!! 😍😍😍
I’m the same thing making no where near that and certification took 10 weeks 🤷🏼‍♀️
Are shifts not like 15hr+ tho 😭
I work at Walgreens & make 16. Scary seeing a lot of y’all settle for $13 in the medical field

"in Romania, even your hair can get stolen"
no way they just said Japan is incredibly safe☠️
pov:you see yellow car:😈
The same is in Finland we have yellow caps for 1st grades named Keltanokka :D
In Germany its standard. Some even walk to kindergarten alone
I want to move to japan 😫😫
Same in finland. So safe that most kids go to school they own. First graders get yellow hat too that cars see them better.
"In Switzerland 2nd graders go home alone with a train,bus or tram 💀"
Most Asian country does this
in Finland the goverment provides yellow caps for all the kids
Italians rn: 😈
In finland everyone does that
I thought it was gonna be Kazakhstan again 💀
in Finland we have also yellow caps so drivers and other road users know that they are new to walking alone and don't know all the rules.
"I walked to school by myself when I was five, but it is seriously safe, I lost my phone twice and it was left there untouched"
What does the simple syrup do? Why is it used?
"SIMPLE SYRUP IS TO ENSURE THE CAKE STAYS MOIST. NO, IT DOES NOT MAKE IT OVERLY SWEET OR SOGGY."
my toxic trait is thinking i could execute this perfectly
Cakegate brought me here 😂
Swirly dookie should’ve never made me laugh so hard. I need to grow up 😭😭
One thing about #CakeGate2023 - my timeline is now filled with REAL bakers and I love it!! 🥰😝🫠
Vanilla apple cake omg that sounds so good
The sound is confusing a sound withing another sound 😳voice over yed but mute the Original voice
can you explain the simple syrup? I've never heard of that before.
One of the most talented bakers i know!!
SWIRLY DOOKIE 😂😂😂😂 I am TWENTY FIVE WHY AM I CACKLING SO HARD
you’re such a good teacher 💞
"""It looks like swirly dookie on the inside"" needs to be a sound"
How do you do a Boston cream cake. I tried and failed miserably 😭
I did catering in college! I always wanted to cut the wedding cake! My fav “snack” was the cake scraps!! 😁
Frozen layers are my go to!
Imagine a lion chasing you and you have to try and outrun it on an EBike
"Dutch people coming in 1,2,3…"

"It’s not a sale. 7balloons is 8.75, then balloon weight is 1.25. So $10. They advertise it that way showing what you can get for 10. I work there"
@the_joker.11
@supply_drop
It’s not a sale … they probably have like 8 balloons plus the weight makes them close to 9 … i used to make them when I worked there
"Is this advertisement for Turo, a credit card, or the mechanics 😏😂"
Turo exec watching this 😳
"Are you claiming Turo as a “small business”, if so, could you write off the devaluation of the vehicle due to the accident?"
So what if you had bad credit and no 13k to pay out of pocket to get the car fixed?
Put a Ferrari bumper on it 💳💥💳💥
This kid from Florida story is insane 😂
Chase ink 😮‍💨
"You forgot the hustle part, you should’ve asked the body shop to put on aftermarket parts and bill them as expensive OEM and keep the difference🤌🏼"
Was this @whistlindieselvstiktok2 😂
"all you need is a new bumper,hood and grill and thats like not even 1,000 so i dont know why they said 15k way to much"
@turo you guys need to get estimate agents to go out to these cars
It’ll never be like new again but it’ll be good enough
Turo watching this thinking “we need to change the policy to aftermarket parts ONLY”😅😅😅
But your title is salvage now
Wait till you find out. You can send them the quote from the expensive repair shop then fix it yourself or take it to a cheap shop and pocket the dif
That card did not give me my bonus
"Except now it has an accident on its CARFAX and diminished value, right?"

"Problem is, as the adult, I'd be in there taking it over 😂"
"Awesome work. Could spend 2-3 hundred for a cheap store bought fort, or spend 2-3 hundred to build a legit fort"
to bad in like 10 years they probably won't touch it it
This went in a direction I wasn't expecting based off the first view.
They'll use it fir 6 months 😂
What’s happens when they’re 17

Patiently waiting for Anki tutorial!! I need any and everything to study for my program
love seeing zoey do big things <3
Girl I’m in my MCN rotation right now and I know how you feel

"Hi, can you do a sample video of how you create Anki questions?"
Ugh I just found you on TikTok I wish I would have found you in the beginning of the semester 😩 I got 3 exams left
Am I looking at the wrong thing or is Anki actually $35 😅
Maternity exam 2 today 🥺
Please do in-depth on anki! I have it and don’t know how to use it
Yes this is a big help i just got into nursing school 😁
im so confused abt anki oh my god
some people can't get a joke
I went through all 84 comments (as of 2:38 February 18th) and there is literally only one person who didn’t get the joke
They even included it in the Toy Story movies! What an outrage
Doesn’t bro realize those are Easter eggs put in there by the makers??🙄🙄🙄 he has it all wrong (i am the one everyone is commenting about)
why does the pizza planet truck keep appearing in this video? it only belongs in toy story.
Can’t believe people cant take a joke (im fighting invisible comments)
The American Sniper one is clearly an easter egg 🤦🏾‍♂️
"it wasn't actually a baby, it was a miniature pizza planet truck 😳😳"
I've never seen this many people mis such a blatantly obvious joke
Fun Fact: They aren't sure what settings they used when creating Toy Story so for every Pixar movie they copy the master file and edit inside the copy
"Silly Jack, this video isn't Toy Story, why did you leave in the Pizza Planet truck?"
Jack? Is this you? Is this all a simulation?
Brave was amazing
"Erm sir, it's a reference. It's not a mistake. I hope you will do better."
How could they mess up so many times 😂😂
"They can’t keep getting away with this, they can’t keep getting away with this!"
that only nine facts 😡 I NEED MY LAST FACT
Fun fact: the pizza planet trucks are actually easter eggs that traditionally appear in other Pixar movies.
don’t even bother jusy be yourself
THERES TOO MANY RULES IM TIRED!
"How to be calm, not overreact and how to spread feminine lighthearted energy: scorpio woman"
Dating doesn’t have to be hard
How do you make your videos look crispy like this???
IM TIRED OF THE RULES
Either he likes you or he doesn’t
So I have to be his peace when he's giving me distress?! I will not be a play ball for any guy. No is no
"Dating shouldn’t be this hard or have this many rules, everyone’s different"
I just want someone to match my energy nobody has time to be playing games
Girl I’ll knock that man between the washer and dryer about my feelings.
If he doesn't miss you when you're gone he's not the one bestie.
"i appreciate your advice, but after experience, i think men will fall for the woman they want to fall for, it doesn't matter how you treat him"
like I always say if he wanted to he would. i shouldn’t have to strategically get him to be “obsessed” with me. if he wants me he’ll put in the work
or find the right person with who u dint need to play games 👌🏻
Be your Authentic self ladies. Be Yourself 💞💞 Either he likes you or he doesn’t. Whatever u do.. dnt over do it.
"Lmfao, this would be like me telling you what pregnancy is like. You have no clue how we operate clearly lol"
"Men are simple. He’s not calling because he’s not interested. Find someone that wants you. Life is too short, each day is a gift"
Do not listen to her coming from a man. Miss your man and be needy real men love that. Be his peace 😪
It’s giving Preston Burke

We all know you said bolillo con queso 😏
Pro baker note. Add the flour first. Then add the salt on top of the flour. This prevents the salt from killing your yeast.
These give me chorro but I love them 🥴😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ours had jamon in it 🤤
Don’t put the salt directly on the yeast though. It weakens it. Mix it in with the flour.
i just use the crossaint premade dough

Apparently everyone in the comments know what it is 💀
That’s not what that is it’s an image.
according to google certain nebula can emit radio waves
@astro_alexandra is this a backup page of yours?
It’s a higher dimensional being siphoning energy from the black hole. That’s what that radio wave image looks like to me
remnants of another galaxy

Capital of Canada is DRAAAKKKEEEE
Incorrect. The correct answer is Downtown Canada.

OTTAWA it the Canada bc I am from Canada

I live in Ottawa
Ottawa. we learned things when I was in school.

One of the greatest sounds in the world for spring time!
"Man yaw got the whole gang there, Hawks , Geese…… and Tom who said” Hold my Spur”"
That’s a fast gobble

Real memphians eat at pirtles. Gus’ is for tourists.
gus fried chicken is so good!!!
Ya need to visit the original spot in Mason.
Gus’s is not all that to me. I live in memphis & fly pass that junt!!
You definitely have to come to Shreveport and try Southern Classic Fried Chicken
"Gus is so overrated no seasoning at all, just buttermilk and hot sauce! Yeah tourists say that they're the best we Memphian know better!"
Next time go to the original one in Mason it’s way better !!!
"welcome to Memphis Tennessee, yes Gus's is the best chicken 🐔 🍗"
Have that in Dallas tx
Omg. The one in Atlanta is so good they have mimosas
omg that looks amazing
Gus’s chicken is great but the sides could be better need some mashed potatoes and gravy
Love it 😍 😍😍

"Nah, the house market will crash soon. I’ll wait till this is 40,000"
Show the price before showing the house!
Show the houses around it Probably in the hood with 100k houses next and front of it
Very nice.. but tax.. and people and governor …
"Well Texas Lotto is currently at 65 Mil, all you need is a dollar and a dream 😂"
I'd be financing the front door handle and barely making the payments.
It's nice but seems a bit cold to me.
So high the price can’t be shared or the video it for props purposes.

I'm convinced IPAs are just the residual byproduct of real beer that is squeegeed through a drain in the floor and filtered through old socks.
“This already stinks” 💀🤣
"You're saying what everyone's thinking, bud. The courage to stand up to big IPA 🙏"
"do not stop this. ever. Unless of course, you succeed in there being none."
Wooden pencil dipped in lemon juice was such a perfect description
I’ve finally found my people.
I’m from the PNW and strangers punch me when I say I don’t like IPAs 😃
🤣 I’m led to understand that a taste for IPAs is physiologically similar to a taste for cilantro.
That was a good pour.
I love IPAs and this was super funny. Your sweater is very nice.
every IPA I have ever tried reminds me of that time I forgot my gym bag with dirty clothes in my car during a texas summer
This made me want an IPA
try Sierra Nevada extra IPA. anything from stone brewery is solid.
"I love IPAs, but I'm gonna follow anyways. You're not entirely wrong"
I love IPAs and I love this account.
I love IPAs and this video.
Do NOT tell my husband that I just liked and followed
"Wonderful idea but i dont think this will not work on all types of hair, just hair that's fine because coarse hair won't slide that easy"
"as soon as I attempt this my 4c hair gonna whisper 🗣""get somebody else to do it"" 🤣🤣"
this aint for us.... dont you dare try this 😂😂😂😂
"Ladies n gents I hope we all know who can & can not attempt this, 😅"
April Fools? 😳
Wont work if you constantly add or subtract from each strand to match size as you braid down
Ehhhhhhh… that would definitely make my 4B/4C hair Super Duper TANGLED 😩😫
Not for every hair grade
Itll cause breakage overtime due to friction 😅 but it is a time saver.
Only if they kept the same hair all the way down.
😧😧never in my life 😂i got to try this 😂
I tried that ONE time 😅 made a knot. 😂 never again
I have 4c hair🥲
don't try this with no feed ins😂
My son has a head full of braids and he has 4C hair and this worked! Thank you!!
Now I want braujist to try this 😳
This will only work on certain hair 😁

Can you make a video on doing the formatting to it can be uploaded because I’m struggling
this is such an over saturated market. and it's not easy at all 💀
I did this. Made 8 books. None of them have sold.
all the journals on amazon 👁️👄👁️
printing isn't free. the cost of printing gets taken out of your royalties. so keep this in mind when pricing your book
Are there not copywriting issues with this?
“ Lifestyles of the rich and famous” except it’s “Hustles for the broke and the lazy”
Bouta make a children’s book & put it up 🤔 are you able to upload your own art into them?
I started this a year ago and it is not for the broke & lazy. I’m a graphic designer so my journals are nice lol but even after spending money on ads
Can someone explain how filing taxes with this kind of income works 😭
can u show what you do after you create it and how to get Amazon to sell it
You look like the mom from evil dead rise but it’s a HUGE compliment bc she’s so freaking pretty
"as an artist, if i uploaded my own designs instead of free templates i feel like it would sell better? can i do that?"
Are they actually gonna get a journal or just pictures
how is this not drop shipping
"Do you personally do it? If yes, how much profit have you gotten back?"
How do you get the income? Like is it credited to your Amazon account or to your bank account
Be careful with this though bc Canva only allows their free templates to be used commercially. Anything Pro Content on canva will be copyrighted.
I make art! I might have to try putting my art on covers of journals and stuff!
"Man I swear if this ruins canva somehow or they start charging more, I’ll be so mad. 🫠"

Well for me it’s 5yrs but yeah

"rent, buy, rent it out. repeat"

You basically just stalk people in this game
you shouldn’t be allowed to get people at their place of worship that’s a rule for senior assassin at our school
You got this
this game is just stalking people..
can u explain senior assassin it seems so fun but i’m confused
I’m too oblivious for this game
At my high school we had “Nerf Wars” instead of Senior Assassin! We form groups and have to eliminate other groups
Spreed sheet is smart but ruins the fun when he told everyone who they had without asking if they wanted to know or not
I’m sorry but all I can think is “ bro last night was like a movie”😂😂💀
bro two kids literally stalked me for DAYYYS outside of my house for this damn game.
that’s not cheating it’s smart
the way my heart was RACING while listening to this
Spread sheets are smart 🤷‍♀️

Obviously you’re not from Texas 😂 but we don’t have snow plows here
We use our salt for margaritas not the road and no one owns a plow. 😂
It will be 80 on Saturday
"this is exactly why the whole state just shuts down in this weather, we don't have the infrastructure to properly handle it. it's too dangerous"
We just stay home the 3 days we have winter here be safe out there
"We just wait for it to melt here, give it 2 days"
"It’s not snow, it’s ice"
He said Texas should be ashamed 😂 where are the plows 😂
Texas only has salt for their margaritas
Don’t shame us! We love it when it’s like this…. No work 😂
Man that ain't snow you driving on that's ice my boi 😁
"We don’t even have a reliable power grid, what’s to say we will get snow plows😭"
We don’t do salt in Texas my boy
Plows lol? We stay home for 2-3 days and wait till it melts and come out. Monday it will be 89 probably 😂
It’s Texas we don’t have no salt 😂😂
Welcome to Texas when we have an Ice Storm they sand the roads no salt though 😳
Why buy plows and salt trucks to use 3 days out of the year?
We Texans already know..... it's something wrong every year
Texas does have snow plows but mostly only used north of Wichita Falls up to Amarillo Texas
No sand here buddy. This only happens every 10yrs lol

What did the plane just call her?!? 👁️👄👁️
Pilot/Security Guard.
Yoooo everyone talking about gender. But this person just buttered that landing!!
"😍 My dream, you’re such an inspiration!"
Cool as a cucumber
So much hate but we all just watched her secure another bag. Period. Great job sis! 👏🏼🔥
If my pilot isn't as good as her I don't want em
"Perfect landing, great job"
Landed it like a boss!
10! Nice landing!
Smooth Operator…… Smooth Operator
Most pilots never get to hear that “5”. That was a phenomenal landing by a phenomenal woman!!!!
I’m a nervous flyer contemplating 1st transatlantic flight. I love the cool confidence/control!!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

I love that carrier
Haha that’s cool 😎
"Now kids, when your aunt Robin was working for the Shield…."

What about the sound though? You have to be able to hear those turbines if you’re anywhere near a population

Am I supposed to be doing a photoshoot at the airport?
My anxiety is always at 10000 at the airport lolol i would look scared and sweaty. 😂😂 But these look amazing
"Anyone else love her advice for posing then when you find yourself taking a photo, you forget everything and resort back to your old basic poses?! 😅"
"I’ll never need airport photos, but these turned out great! They all made a huge difference."
Now if only I can remember them when the time comes lol.
"It’s all about the hair, outfit and angles —-which I have none of during travel days 😂"
Except I only wear a hoodie and sweat pants 😩
The camera person is the problem 😏I need to teach my husband this things
I love the idea thank you beautiful 🌸🎀✈️🥰

Ok if I posed like that at the airport my husband would hide.
Love it!!🥰

I love Minnesota and my favorite place I've visited once was Minneapolis and Pipestone National Monument! I love it so much it was so beautiful!
"It's beautiful there for sure. I grew up around the headwaters of the Mississippi. Itasca is pretty good, but no North Shore."

My ADHD is screaming to learn how to do this. Atp I'm one hobby/interest away from being Barbie 😅😂😂😂😂

"For those wondering, the song is called ‘Im Cal the Dragon’ by Cal the Dragon"
"Ironic how his name is Malachi, literally means “my angel” or “gods messenger” in Hebrew. Such an angelic voice ."
"I think he’s 13, not 30. 😂"
He absolutely deserved that golden buzzer
He doesn’t even look like he’s trying 😭 he just lookin at the audience like 👁️👁️while he belts out rifts
It was like an entrance song to heaven or something 🥰
absolutely amazing. his mouth opened and heaven flowed out
He's also being incredibly smart and allowing the mic to amplify his voice rather than trying to belt it out.
"Just me, or did his voice make anyone else cry! 😢"
"I don't know what I expected, but this was not it. absolutely stunning ❤️"
He is already known in the classical world. He has sung as a soloist with choirs and orchestras. So happy is gaining a bigger audience with this show
"This one, we protect at all costs"

I’m convinced you’re the one that stripped the bolt
my brain broke at the welded part lol
He just wrote a Dr. Seuss book for mechanics. Trade mark that good sir!!
so if the non spinny spin spun then the bolt would come off?
"So basically, it’s not supposed to Spinney spun spun"
That sort of thing is on most modern cars g
I think my brain is spiny spun spin after that
"you have to find the key combination, from left to right spuning sping 😂"
I had a guy do the same thing then he cut through the a arm to cut the bolt. Thank goodness he didn't get all the way through.
Dont forget it hits the tie rod end when you pull it all the way out😐
U had me on spin
You missed the part about it spinning
Bluetooth welds
Is the supposed to be an eccentric adjustment 😂😂😂
What about your coolant leak

"Turn the music up a little bit, we can almost hear dialogue and we can't have that"
"I need that power ""PAIN""😁😁😁😁"
I love the look Bella gives her.
It's actually kind of horrifying to know E&B's relationship checks every box on what abusive relationship traits are red flags.

PAIN 😂😂😂😂😂 me imagining I come in and solo all of them😂😂😂😂😂

anybody wondering why the Tide detergent was in the fridge😳😳😳😳
Everyone wondering why the detergent in the fridge but I’m over here wondering why he put it back in the fridge after he soften the cream cheese
They put the detergent in the fridge to get more comments it’s genius😅
I just want to know how they got it out of the crockpot
why not just use funfetti cake mix??
Why Would you need to add MORE sugar?? it all had sugar in it - pudding/ cereal & cake mix. 😏
why make it in 30 minutes when you can make it in 2 hours! everyone is so creative
Sprite instead of water
Is it driving anyone else crazy not knowing exactly how much melted butter he poured in? 😂
@thecoreyb you got to try this.
It’s great
@north_omaha_cat_lady wait till they open the fridge. duet please!!!!
I bet it tastes like a McDonald’s holiday pie
Everybody’s so creative
"how did you get it out of the crockpot with it killing

"People don’t want to clean pools, mow lawns and buff floors at check out!!"
It should be illegal to own 96 income properties
Airbnb pushed themselves out. You can’t even have guests at airbnbs anymore & they expect you to clean before you leave + a cleaning fee
Or people are tired of fees. I’d prefer staying at a Marriott or Hilton.
airbnb is a huge reason why we have a housing problem
"I was a loyal Airbnb user, they got greedy, I went back to hotels"
Also tourists do not want an AirBnB an hour+ from Glendale lmao
They've gotten so expensive that a hotel is cheaper now. I'm not at all surprised.
You mean price gouging can backfire??
Tbh I’m sick of the list of things to do before I leave and then on top of that at least a $100 cleaning fee. Gimme a hotel.
Its probably the cleaning fee
Sell the houses back to locals
You know they are wayyyyyyy over charging
Phoenix has so many hotels.
Pro tip: Book a hotel
How this guy has almost 100 rental properties is the most concerning part for me 😳
I’m back to hotels.
Let’s hope so! Nauseating that 21k homes aren’t available to actual residents!
This is why long term rentals are hard to find and completely unaffordable in the Valley
the way sarabi protect nala🥹
"Wish the voice of scar was the same as the cartoon version ,it sounded scary this sounded just normal person😡"

This interview explains everything I need to know about James Corden
the hair bro 😂😂😂
Biden is just bored at this point
Why is James Cordon that popular
I thought great Britian was 5 hours ahead not behind.
@AnaF “boris talks to me all the time” ofc he does😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Yeah but not all of the answers his calls anymore 😂
The Good year blimp interviewing senators Biden
Ice-cream question like a kindergarten baby
watching this exactly 3:00pm 😳
😂He is so handsome man
Boris Johnson is not awake yet..
we are 5 hours ahead of the US? so it'd be 8pm
Don't like him as a president but I love him as just a regular chill guy
This is a joke 🤣
Who the heck has been saying that they smelled ?
You cannot convince me they did not smell to our modern sensibilities.
they where clean but it was not like that on the 1700 .
Renaissance was funky.
Are they confusing Victorian with medieval? Also I tried so hard to see the original comment it disappears so quick. Love the facts though!
we're nudists much of a thing back then? i i j imagine those clothes must be a sensory nightmare id so feel trapped
Not very convincing. They're just using standing water.
That first line? I GUFFAWED
"I just LOVE your videos. They’re so informative and well-researched, but short and easy to understand at the same time!"
Took them long enough 😂
What did people think of how the streets or town smelled with the horses and everything? Were they used to it?
Don’t forget dress protectors! They could swap out underarm pads to keep clothes from soaking in sweat
are these just rich ppl tho?
What a positive difference to the ancien regime!! 😃😃
Wasn’t ‘Cleanliness is next to godliness’ a popular Victorian mantra? Often referring to purity (morality) of mind and cleanliness of body.
"I think people dont understand that people through history may not have submerged or showered, but regularly washed their body…."
"So just those who were hard at work and with little means to buy clothing at will, so only the poor stank 😲"
The drawer slipping into the trash can would’ve been the last straw for me lmao
my husband wont even let me try furniture flipping because he said he's gonna end up doing all the work. he's probably right 😂

The voiceover was just as entertaining as watching you make this stunning piece
The wood filler with stencils for a carved look is genius
woah when you’re done those look super expensive
Please tell me you made at least three or $400 on it at least
*likes to keep it real but doesn’t name the bad product so we know what NOT to use* 😭
I just know it was Citrus Strip
The narrating of this video is the best part! Sounds like you should narrate a tv show or something lol
The wood filler stencil idea was awesome and it looks great
Thank you!! I was nervous but they turned out great!
You’re design eye and vision is amazing! Love that you work with your Dad and your commentary (and singing) is the best!
oh.my.god. watching this made my heart rate accelerate bc i did the same exact process on a dresser for my nursery at 7 months pregnant. PTSD for real
I would have just burned it and moved on 😂
Your narration is why I watch every video from beginning to end 🥰
I was loving the energy on this one😂😂😂
The voice over is giving me life 😂 because I felt every part of this transformation in my soul hahah
When you kept telling yourself “Amanda why” I was I don’t knowwwww 😂😂 but also ✨felt✨
"Thats not a backyard, thats a national freaking park the size of Canada 😂"

walking up those stairs is like a full blown workout
House update pleaseee🥺🥺
@. dream house part 2
That is not a house thats a damn palace
wdym let’s go to the third story
This house is everything
I need a better view of the stairs. like when you walk in what does the entrance look like
I would never move out
When I grow up I want a house like that🥺🥺🤞🏻💖
But mullein is such a good medicinal plant for humans!
What if used for the Asian carp problem?
Mullin is great for respiratory ailments
Black walnut does the same thing. Crazy right.
Guess it would work in a survival situation
😂what you doing? Me? Nothing just hanging around
"It doesn't kill them so you can use it, pick the fish you want to eat and the ones you leave will recover. If it wasn't illegal I mean."
one of my favorite plants to forage
Indigenous used a different plant for this and it was native and I know exactly which plant it is.
Roofie for fish😂
good to know if I'm lost
good to know where does it commonly grow?
That's a powerful plant !
"And it’s found around so many streams and creeks. Go figure. I keep mullein well stocked in my pantry for earaches, congestion etc."
useful to know for any survival situation
Wow! I love Molen. I had no idea. It is one cool plant. People used to put it in the soles of their shoes like for comfort.
interesting I use mullen for medicine. its very good for colds and flues.
At least Owen Wilson is proud of me…. Thanks! (Also thanks for giving me some dads)
Mark Wahlberg when he's stressed always sounding like he's out of breath 😂😂😂 impression was on point
Owen Wilson on point bro 💀
All of these are impressive

"“I’m X and i’m ivy, and welcome to fact or cap”"
y’all worried about it dry i’m just worried about the $13 coconut oil she bought
But nobody is showing when it dries
"I thought when she got in her car, she was gonna back it up and get it scratched on purpose 😂 then do the hack"
Coconut oil cures everything
Only thing I’ve learned that take the scratches out of car pain is gasoline!
It's just moisturizing the car 😂 when it dries scratches will still be there.
"car detailer here, DONT EAT YOUR CLEARCOAT WITH VINEGAR"
The oils are filling the scratch but once it gets washed the oils will come off.
It’s been 11hrs let’s see the results
Not you opting for the more expensive ORGANIC coconut oil 😂😂🥰🥰
I’m gonna need to try this! Darn fences keep appearing outta nowhere with me.
I guess I'm going to the store too 😁😁
It works until it rains 😅
@katieeh55 for your rim??

Buncombe County won’t let us use toilet 90s no more because “flanges are designed to go inside” 4 inch.

Dude....you busted the flange when you took out the middle piece!!!!!
them inside pipe cutters best thing ever
did you just flush that rag afterwards?
ok...I saw the primer... did I miss the cement?
"Love the nylon Johnny bolts, they are a game changer"

I don’t like the plastic flanges. Prefer the stainless steel ring. Just my preference
Maybe Turn Your 4×3 around if you want to pass just saying
I love those Sioux Chief nylon bolts. But I use their caps too.

"Please show the tenderness by cutting with utensils because when I put most beef in crockpot it is chewy so use insta pot pressure, then sauté, so yum"
Do you think I could put this on low for 10 hours if I’m going to work ?

Was it stew beef you used? Thanks
You don’t need all that much liquid?

How did you not brown it first? That’s just stew.
How’s the engine noise in that master right next to the engine room!

Above and beyond RV families. More than a curtain for privacy of their cupboard bedrooms
Money money money
Why do I feel poor. Their boat is bigger than my house.
This boat has such a great layout. Beautiful. Boat goals
Too fast
The mom in me is screaming “what if they hit their head and fell in?” I should probably talk to my therapist about that. Beautiful family 🥰
Why are we going so fast!!😂
ahhh just thinking of the fuel price
beautiful boat has more Sq ft than my house.
so much better than the rv people carrying the kids around all the time with zero privacy

game in ohio
No because she's really upsetting me.
that girl was being extra 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Is she like acting or what. I don’t get it
the girl was making me hella mad
is she broken
When she tried to take a bite of his 3rd slice my skin itched
She act like their playing musical chairs 😳 😂
Why’s she there???
Why are people mad at the girl what did she do
I can't believe I watched this entire video
the guy with the most slices is definitely a winner... he was pushing the one with none. 👍👏👏
Giving ur friend the chance to win is the real deal 👍
Think we all know who’s idea this was 😅
the girl tho...
see me yelling yayyy😂😂😂 when the last guy with no wins eventually won😁
Why do I feel like they all kept missing on purpose so that one guy could have a slice but he kept missing and missing😭
Anyone else stick around to see if dude would finally get a slice
She gets in his Way every single time!!!!!
Where is Nigerian American?
I think the big thing is that our parent supported us financially to set us up for success. They know to invest for a bigger reward
They come here already wealthy educated or connected
Multi generational house hold can help prevent delinquency.
As soon as you mentioned red lining and social barriers I knew you were valid 💯 smart man
West Indian or Caribbean families too
(Higher members from the caste were also able to come to the states)
Most of them do overtime in their field
"point number 3 is the key. I am an african immigrant and my family is split into accounting & engineering. no music, no sports."
I live in an Indian neighborhood they don’t waste money on materialistic stuff and it’s a lot of them in one apt everyone works and saves their money
Spot on. When I was 19 I was taking max credit hours at University since I had no financial liabilities. Parents were supporting me. Now I support ‘em
In America when we turn 18 we: leave or our parents tell us to leave. I’m telling my daughters to stay home until they are married or graduate college
"This is very dope but it also fails to mention w/most foreign countries, only a small percent(normally educated) are immigrating"
This study was 10 years ago now its way more 😂😂
"I agree, focusing on education, having a support system to watch the kids, and marrying with your culture, which is less stress, is a winning formula."
"I think this is only HALF of the truth around this feedback. So many other realities are missed here, especially with business/entrepreneurship."
"Love these conscious answers! Love that you acknowledged the access to loans, funding, and housing oppose to other minorities 🙌"
Great analysis. You just earned yourself a follower
I watched his video but kept thinking financial success doesn’t equate to fulfilling purposeful life.
"our parents set us up for success cuz they came from 3rd world country’s, wonder how the stats will change with when 2nd gen have kids"
